I ain’t really with it 
I don’t carry that piece on me 
I don’t got money stack to the roof 
I’m just skating by 
I’m hella average 
What do I bring to the table 
If I’m being honest I don’t really know 
I’m inspired by these great artists like Wayne 
He got hits on hits and still got the burner on him 
He ain’t afraid to bleed a nigga if they test him 
Two hoes on his side fuck em once then drop them
He living the life cuz he made it 
He earned it and I respect it he the greatest 
He came up from nothing
