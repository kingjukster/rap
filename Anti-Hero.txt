I got a lot of problems on my plate
I really wish they would just go away.
They ain't ever saved the day
They love to hate, but I'm strong like superman
Creative like peter pan, but I can't take you to Netherlands
Rather see you die, does that make me an evil man?
 
 
I got a few problems
It's a whole different story when you don't know how to solve em
Might just kill a nigga like tory
I'm the anti-hero
All I get is hate
I use it as fuel, this shit easy like I'm cutting cake
The real are real, the fake like to celebrate
Never met a girl that knew me, just blew me
Looking me in the eyes, staring right through me
Gave her a ring, now she tryna room me
Talking about how she love the new me
Never met a nigga that could see me
They tryna pursue me, I'm talking conceited like they can't be me
That's where I went wrong, I thought I was star bound
Head in the clouds I couldn't find the ground
Ten years later and I'm just standing around
My brain is a workplace and my thoughts are just wandering around
Who would've thought two puffs two years ago would've rotted them away
Two years ago I thought the stars were aligned and it was just fate
Fast-forward to now, I'm sitting on this counter, arms shaking, texting you I'm afraid
No answer, just silence, let my thoughts pave the way
One ring, shes typing, maybe there is hope today
Two rings, message received, maybe it is fate
one message, two worlds, destroyed on this day
Is it okay to make them pay

Yes, but can't you see that's what we need to become
bottle up all that hate, it's your power source, like the sun
 
I hate you, I'm lost, I need your favor
My heart is black, that's your fault, I have no savior
All them years, who would've thought, she'd leave ya
I'm not weak, I have strong thoughts, I don't need ya
Can't you see, you caused all this pain, you're the weak one
I don't need to listen, I've heard enough, you can't teach me
I'd rather die, than look at you again,  all that weakness
I'm a product of my past, sad and evil, where does that leave us?
My first  instinct is to be mad, but I know that's not right, why can't I see this?
Some things don't change, and we're one of them, why do we do this
It's time to meet a friend, Luci is particular, he'll be pleased to meet ya
 
All them nights you laid awake praying
Asking God for a path to forgiveness
Your words don't fall on deft ears
Pray to Luci and you too can repent your sins
Luci will teach you how to hate your father
When all else seems lost Luci will pick you up
And all Luci asks in return is a dollar
