BBK, BBK, BBK
BBK, BBK, BBK
BBK, BBK, BBK
I know you got a lot to say 
I’m set to blow any day 
BBK, BBK, BBK



Y’all niggas be doing things, then talking about the hind sight 
The consequences come in and hit you from the blind side 
Bitches wish they could take cock back like a revolver 
You say you’re not about the drama, but can’t wait to involve her 
I’m tired of the he said she said name callers 
I’m talking broke at the mall wannabe Gucci models 
Glossed up irresponsible celebrity idols 
Fill the bar with syllables just to hit a high note 
Something’s gotta change, but what do I know 
Taking six private jets from Springfield to Chicago 
How does the environment feel? How the fuck would I know?
Fighting a war 
we’re losing fast
I’m tellin y’all 
we gotta get back 
We gotta fight back 
Looking in the past, 
where’d it go wrong 
I said I love you
And believed it too long 
Hates an evil place 
That makes the small strong  

This our song, we waving, we vibin 
We calling out everybody that ain’t ridin 
If we don’t fuck wit you, you’re not in our station, with guidance 
We on a whole different plane, there’s vibin, inside us 


Animosity on the walls drippin on your balls 
Y’all fucking on hate, making love from a bad place 
Fuck around and make a mistake, bring a baby with no grace 
Lost in another world you try to rekindle the love with a fireplace 
A family sized van, diapers and a can, living life stuck in place 
He’s out who knows where he stays, single mother till the clock hits midnight then you R.A.A
That stands for Ready And Available , just let me know and I’ll take you where we go
Y’all lay in bed smelling like defeat, knowing damn well there are secrets to keep 
Cuddling with your man cuz you know he keep the heat 
Like oil in a pan, you keep the lid out  
You don’t wanna be garbage, so you let it play out 
Situational beauty, you blow him and he tells you to get the fuck out 
You questioning your choices but it’s kinda late now 
You got a four year old and a nigga that rides with a crew now 
Sounds dangerous but he said he’ll keep you safe and you didn’t ask how 
You praying to the lord, please keep my son safe, but he can’t save you now
