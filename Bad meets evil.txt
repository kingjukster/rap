Body: 
My boys got hate for others 
My clique tight, we brothers 
We won’t let you in, you’ll suffer 
Read that line again, I ain’t stutter 
Get caught by the group, and we’ll put you on blast 
Your outfit wack, can’t be saved by those Nike air max 
Trailer park living, you ain’t ever seen some stacks 
Full head of makeup, please take off that mask 
It’s four in the morning, go start your shift 
Quit calling it corporate, it’s McDonald’s, go clock in 
Who’s really looking, some old white men?
You’re wearing a uniform, quit with the bra that lifts 
Your work husband, with the perm, he won’t save you, when will you learn 
He’s 17 and still in high school 
He smokes weed and pops pills, his friends told him it’s cool 
But you still let him hit, now you think about it at night while you toss and turn 

Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil 
Don’t call the cops, cuz this is all legal 
He’s evil, and she’s bad like Cherie Deville
That’s their charm, their toxic appeal
They broke up and came back for the sequel
Together they make, bad meets evil

You been rinsing and repeating for far too many cycles 
There’s expectations he’s not meeting, he’s really going  psycho 
Suicidal thoughts fleeting , is this really how life goes 
He always think you’re cheating, who’s this guy named Michael 
Gimme your phone ho, get this shit unlocked 
Where’d you go, where were you, at 5 o’clock 
Fucking with the bros?, that’s enough to get yo ass socked 
You better speak up ho or hear this gun cock 
You said you was with Tiffany, but where’d you really go
Tiffany was with me, that’s all you need to really know 
I bet you were on your knee, you fucking slut, you fucking ho
Let me take that back I’m sorry, I’ll pack my things and go 
Sike, if you want to leave me, you can, in a body bag 
I got your phone tracked, and your clothes tagged 
The doors locked, and I got you gagged 
You shouldn’t have tested me, you shouldn’t have stabbed
You’re bad

Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil 
Don’t call the cops, cuz this is all legal 
He’s evil, and she’s bad like Cherie Deville
That’s their charm, their toxic appeal
They broke up and came back for the sequel 
Together they make, bad meets evil

And I’m evil 
I was born to be a rebel 
I don’t need you bitch, I don’t have to settle 
You cross me bitch, you’re fucking with the devil 
Give me one good reason to keep you around 
Quit talking bitch, don’t make a sound 
You’re a burden, your friends are shitty all they do is hound 
Bitch I loved you, remember when we used to pound 
I should stab you and let three liters drain out 
Sit there and watch you, as you slowly pass out
If that happens you won’t wake up, I don’t think you want that route 
So if you have second thoughts, better let go of that doubt 
Next time won’t be so easy, matter fact let me teach you a lesson 
Slash across yo leg, for all the stressin
Here’s a towel, fuck all the stichin
Dinners late, get in the fucking kitchen 

Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil 
Don’t call the cops, cuz this is all legal 
He’s evil, and she’s bad like Cherie Deville
That’s their charm, their toxic appeal
They broke up and came back for the sequel 
Together they make, bad meets evil

That’s it, she fucking had it
She walked to the kitchen, then kept going past it 
Walked up the stairs and opened up the closet 
Moved some stuff around and grabbed it
Bitch where my food at , I know you not in the kitchen 
Imma count to three and then I swear I’ll be trippin
I’ll back hand you so hard, your cheeks will kiss like they twerkin 
I’m pissed off, bitch, I don’t give a fuck who I’m hurtin
Then you don’t care who I’m hurtin, nigga get up on your knees 
Shut the fuck up, I don’t care about a “please”
You done fucked up, you can’t numb the pain like the trees 
Got me fucked up I’ll give the trigger a squeeze
You point that gun at me, you better pull the trigger 
Why’d I ever get with yo broke ass, nothing you say is meaningful 
As she turned the gun on herself, a smile on her face grew bigger 
And as she pulled the trigger, she mumbled out “see you in hell for the sequel”
