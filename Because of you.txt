Yea 

Because of you 

I’m on my Kodak shit 

Haha

You may of broke my heart 
Crushed my dreams 
And used me up 
But you taught me one thing 
How to be better 
And because of you 
I’ll be better 
Not for you 
But for the next one 
You can watch from the distance 
And see that I’m finally happy 
But you can never come back 
Im playing games on my phone 
But I ain’t thinking about you 
Haha get it
I bet you do but they don’t 
That was our song but not anymore it’s yours now 
I don’t live in the past anymore 
That’s your home not mine



[ EXPERIMENT 
(Could switch the flow)
But believe me this ain’t no love song 
Don’t you hear those gun sounds 
Don’t come near me or you’ll have a gun frown 
I’ve done told you that you’re worthless 
But now imma show it ]

I bet you thought you had me 
You really thought you could hold me 
Clearly you don’t know me well 
I was sad then but I’m back now 
And I’m stronger then ever
Better believe that now 
I applaud your try 
You did have me in the first half 
But now that I’m back you can sit down 
I’ll take it from here little girl 
And hold on cuz it’s gonna be a long ride 
And believe it when I say I’m gonna hit every bump 
Let you feel all the pain that I felt 
Let me share my emotions with you 
We can call it my last gift to you 
No need to thank me you definitely deserved it
These immense emotions prolly crush your shoulders 
You can’t carry them 
Maybe I should help you 
But wait 
Lemme think 
Did you ever help me 
Did you ever stop to ask how I was 
No, you didn’t 
(I didn’t think you did )
Maybe I should add a couple more pounds on your shoulders just to make it even 
After all you do deserve it 
You pussy ass nigga 
I will not forgive it 
You will never be welcome here 
please do not forget it
