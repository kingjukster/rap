Body: 
Niggas quiver when they hear my voices 
Spit bars louder than thunder like I’m Morgan Freeman 
You bitches can call me Moses
The way I Split the rap game in half like I’m parting the seas 
I’m new to this rap shit 
But I’m already an og 
This isn’t even a career I’m no rapper 
This is my way to explain how I feel 
Bottle all my anger into a pen and write my feelings away
