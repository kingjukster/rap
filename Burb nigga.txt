What’s the word nigga 
What’s the word 
We ain’t from the burbs nigga 
You can get yourself curbed 
what’s the word nigga

Niggas chirpin got me in my head 
Gotta cut the birds off and focus on the bred 
I been stuck in a cycle of self loath and regret 
I gotta flip the script and get a check 
Money talk loud on anybody’s neck
Speak up, it’s all about respect 
Salute the king, the mother fucking best 
Talk loud, this chess, I’ll put you in check 
Your a pawn in this game 
Steal your rook like I’m a crook 
Creeping at knight, take your queen 
Put that pussy on a pedestal 
And send her back like “nah it’s cool”
A check in the pocket for 10k 
A reminder this shit real 

What’s the word nigga 
What’s the word 
We ain’t from the burbs nigga 
You can get yourself curbed 
what’s the word nigga
