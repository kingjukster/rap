Body: 
A butterfly floating in the sky
An ever-burning pit of fire
Delicate touch without the need to try
Pain in each step, incremental tire
 
The butterfly circles the pit
Fire jumps from end to end
Still, the butterfly looks for a place to sit
So too does the eruption begin
 
To the center, the butterfly goes
Mounds of lava serve as a warning
Continuing regardless of who oppose
In the center the butterfly finds mourning
 
And so, it sits and listens
And soon enough the lava is in remission
