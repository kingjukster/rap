Let go of my hand 
I won’t pull you up 
It’s not my job it’s not my responsibility 
You have to have the ability to help yourself 
You have to see the point and grab it 
You have to be able to move 
Ina direction it doesn’t have to be the right one it just has to be one 
You need a start a beginning 
Beginning lead to ends and ends lead to results 
And to tell you the truth i don’t care what the results
