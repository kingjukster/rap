I just want to smell like Chanel number five 
I wanna feel like I’m here by design 
everything I do just feel like a crime 
Can’t I just drown in Mary sublime 

Chanel number five it carry my pride 
Empty my pockets and let the cash glide 
Chanel number five it’s how I survive 
empty my pockets it’s how I pass time 

Broke, pocket check, Chanel number five
I can’t do nothing, my hands been tied 
Look at the papers, the history ain’t surprised 
You ain’t selling nothing that hasn’t been signed 
I’m poised to enter my prime 
If I died it’d be a fucking crime 
Sold my soul for a dime 
Can’t pick it up, can’t beat it up 
Why did I pick it up, why’d I beat it up
