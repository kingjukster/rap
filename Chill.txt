Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it 
Quiet, quiet, quiet
Stop it, stop it, stop it

Please be quiet, please be quiet 
My mind is a riot, a riot 
I can’t keep it quiet, quiet 
My feelings, I can’t hide it 

Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it 
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it 

I feel my mind, I’m losing it 
I can’t remember my name, oh yea that’s right 
I DONT HAVE ONE, Please be quiet 
Last thing I remember was fire 
I keep pushing it back, getting higher 
But I won’t smoke tonight, oh no 
I won’t smoke tonight, oh no 
I’m mad, I want to feel the anger 
When I get high, I just feel like a stranger 
You’re not you when you’re hungry
I’m not me without the money 
I’ve felt nothing since a young me 
Got a picture in my phone, to remind me 
Of the pain and hunger, hunger 
Don’t talk to me, be quiet, quiet 
I feel the old me, the anger, anger 

Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it 
Quiet, quiet, quiet
Stop it, stop it, stop it

Please be quiet, please be quiet 
My mind is a riot, a riot 
I can’t keep it quiet, quiet 
My feelings, I can’t hide it 

Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it 
Quiet, quiet, quiet 
Stop it, stop it, stop it
