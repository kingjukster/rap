Body: 
Sitting in my bed looking at the ceilin 
Dreamin schemin 
Of that day when I’m that nigga 
But for now imma have to be content 
With not being it 
Set goals and hold 
Know imma be there one day 
Know imma have it 
Terrell 
Name in the mouth of everyone 
Set aside with greats 
Big Tupac Wayne em 
Them all 

Niggas love to hate 
But they just want what I have 
Don’t really know why 
Cuz what do I have
Empty pockets 
Empty head 
What am I even spittin 
 I wrote what’s on the mind 
But what do I do when there’s nothing left on my mind 
Pull from something else 
Tap into the internet 
Look like America the way I’m scavenging for resources 
From this page where everybody sharing freestyles 
Damn some of these niggas really spittin 
Why can’t I have it like them 
Shit makes me look like I’m not trying 
Now I’m feeling real shitty 
Well I mean ain’t nobody really using these bars 
So why don’t I grab a couple 
Just to borrow 
I won’t use to many
Just a lil something until I can think of something to write 

Damn now my shit really poppin 
Got labels on my line telling I’m next 
On the line with x said I can be the best 
Soon I got a whole fan base chanting 
“You nigga you rock”
“When you gonna drop a album that shit would pop” 
Yea maybe they right I gotta write 
Sit in my room staring at my book of rhymes 
Why em make it look so easy 
I can’t think of a damn thing 
Shit what I need to write for fuck that shit 
Im already poppin 
Pick up my phone got like a Hunnid messages 
“Boy when the album coming I need that fire” 
And a thousand more messages like it 
Shit a nigga got no choice 
I need some Inspo 
Lemme get on internet 
Come a cross that same damn website 
Shits brewing in my head 
I’m sure a nigga won’t mind if I borrow a little 
Couple months later and I got me a whole album 
And all dem niggas listenin 
Shits poppin 
Fan base doubled 
Ten thousand niggas huddled 
Waiting for me to hop out 
So I pop out 
I rap my heart out 
Couple days later shit leaks 
Phone blowing up 
Twenty niggas claiming I took they bars tryna sue me for everything I have 
I ain’t ever seen these niggas in my life 
I lawyer up tell em I ain’t do shit 
Get to court look around 
Everybody already sittin down 
Prosecutors stands up and asks me if I recognize this 
I look at it and damn it’s that same mf website
