If it’s corny it’s true 
Don’t forget it could happen to you 
It’s so entertainin
Smokin and drankin 
Showing off franklins 
Keep it a hundred 
Like the lines before 
Bitches all around 
Shit it’s bitches galore 
What a night Let’s run it back 
Call it an encore 
Now we rolling 
Into the hospital it’s 4 
In the morning 
I’m mourning 
Sweating shaking waking 
Wobbling hobbling 
Help can see
