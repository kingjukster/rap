Who am I?
I am no one
A ghost of the past and a glimpse of what could be 
Darkness rules the room there is nothing to see
One sliver of light is what I look for 
One last chance is what I hope for 
Two knocks on the door 
I open it up to nothing 
Can’t say I’m surprised 
I’ve opened this door probably a thousand times 
And the same thing I see 
Nothing 
I look into the eyes of darkness itself 
What I see is myself 
An endless pit of agony 
Darker than my skin 
Darker than my heart 
Colder than the night
