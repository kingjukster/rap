Dear life 

Greetings, to you
Writing through this piece of paper, to you 
Who knew, 
I’d be writing, to you 
These words painting pictures, to you 
I don’t know you, but I just need a few clues
And I’ll put it together like who’s who 
But wait, there’s more 
My life starting to feel like a real bore 
But there’s you 
You make me want to go find more 
And there’s more, god knows she’s beautiful 
But there’s not a thing for me to do 
And that’s the pain of the story from me to you 
Just bystander watching game not a thing to do 
That’s the oldest story in the book believe me true 


I think but he doesn’t move 
I don’t know what the fuck to do 
And I go to you 
But you got stuff to do 
Well that’s rough for who
Uncomfortable
