Dear mama I’m going through the ringer 
I feel like I’m on edge, on the brink a 
Disaster, thoughts in my head they linger
It don’t matter, I was always a thinker 


Loves a dirty game baby, 
so just make sure you wanna play baby 
Cause deep down I really cares baby 
I been taking baby steps over giant stairs baby 
My life ain’t the one to spare baby 
I wear no halo, but I live in the clouds baby 

Grab my hand and we can find out 
Don’t you wanna see what’s at the top 
Im in your head, I can see your thoughts 
Is this the means for which you fought 

Sitting on the throne looking favorable 
I’m no hero, but you look savable 
Maybe I climb the ladder of your soul 
Even when I fall I get up cuz I know it’s makeable
