Body: 
Hot summer day and I shiver 
Got a layer of ice round me 
But I know it’s just my mental 
Think I’m color blind cuz everything look gray 
Like mom help nothing is as fun as it used to be 
People ask me what’s wrong like hell if I know 
They say I been kinda out of it 
But I think the world just running from me 
I swear I was flying so high and they clipped my wings 
Had to toss out my mood ring 
Shit was broke wouldn’t change from blue 
Who knew life could be so uninteresting 
Can’t stop my body from resting 
Life was on autopilot but I wasn’t flying 
Friends don’t understand I know they here to help 
But I can’t see them like I’m blind
