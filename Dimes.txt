You dropping dimes on a line 
I’m fucking dimes on the times 
You on par for the time 
Like gunna and sixnine 

Before you clown let me take you class 
It take some strong shoulders to shrug it off and act with some class
You ain’t a man at all if you can finish the task 
No matter the cost, despite the past
