I go hard 24/7 
I don’t like it when people go hard back 
if you come at me 
You better come with all you got 
Cuz I’m coming right back 
you better not give up 
Cuz I don’t 
You better grind hard 
Cuz I do 
I want to win 
No matter what
Over love
Over hate 
Over money guns drugs lust
No matter what
Everything I do is competitive 

I want to win
I’m ready too
I won 
where’s the awarder?
This a?
Shit I think I got a personality disorder 

I want to win
I’m ready too
I won 
where’s the awarder?
This a?
Shit I think I got a personality disorder
