Body: 
20 years in the game
And all I’ve learned is one thing 
Sometimes you have to roll with the fake 
To really make it 

I can’t be me 
Too many inconsistencies 
I have to look inside 
That shits too hard to see 
I live with criticism inside my head 
I am the best 
Overexaming to prove it 
That’s why I can’t go to bed 
My whole life frozen in a prism 
I can’t reflect on it 
My mind won’t allow it 
Living life in a prison
