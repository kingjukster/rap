Where they at now 
Where they at now 
Where they at now 
Where they at now 

There’s a lot of fuck niggas in front of me 
Copying my flow to stunt all up onto me 
I’m tired of these arm leach niggas tryna to latch onto me 
I gave you the blueprint but you forgot a piece
You took off to Arby’s and forgot the meat 
Cooking with these lame bars leave your meat sitting bleu
Your idea of rap is lost and misconstrued 


You’re a copycat, you’re a clone 
I sent your mom crying home 
I’m your father don’t get me wrong 
You’re my clone , my Eminem clone
