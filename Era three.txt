Body: 
Catch me on the strip 
Drag racing in my whip 
You can’t say nothing to me bitch
Cuz I’m really about this shit
I ain’t fuck the bitch 
But I did send the diss 
Mess around and get the dip stick 
Like I pulled out the third switch
Nigga my hit don’t miss 
Come with the lightning like gods fist 
Thunder the way the smoke miss 
Stevie wonder wouldn’t miss this 

This the type of shit to get you dismissed 
And I’m not talking a court case, I’m talking your head 
Type of shit to make a nigga wish he was dead 
Death a fine mistress you wish you never had kissed 


Niggas in the trenches and the plots thickening 
Niggas pinchin pennies and the pots they pissin in 
Niggas poppin friends in the house they livin in 
Someone call the cops but they ain’t listenin 
8 year old daughters sold their soul chasing men 
But that’s just how it goes till their family missin em 
And that’s just how it goes till their family missin em 


This the second verse, better learn a lesson first 
Bitch I’m well versed, rocking back in a Louie V shirt 
And you already know my bitches knees hurt 
And she know I love to tease her 
Really got a nigga feeling like Caesar 
But I can’t let a bitch know I need her 

That’s why I wake up feeling like a million bucks
Had to quit the weed everything was feeling rushed
Weight of the world, I just put my hand to my shoulder and brush 
I’m freer than any nigga, even in gods house, I cuss
A nigga be asking the world why, all it says is because 
I’m sheading all that weight now, its era three
I found what works, what’s best for me 
Drop that hero shit, it’s a villain arc, best believe 
I pull my blind fold down an shoot my shots, it’s destiny 
If I miss a shot, know you got that for free 


Niggas in the trenches and the plots thickening 
Niggas (pinchin) pennies and the pots they pissin in 
Niggas poppin friends in the house they livin in 
Someone call the cops but they ain’t listenin 
8 year old daughters sold their soul chasing men 
But that’s just how it goes till their family missin em 
And that’s just how it goes till their family missin em
