Body: 
I got a glock in my pants 
You niggas don’t want to dance 
Moves like MJ 
The last dance 
My word play on fleet 
And you best bet I don’t cheat
I ain’t with these sloppy niggas 
You wanna be me 
I am me 
We are not the same 
I do not do drugs 
They slow me down 
I’m heading to the top 
But I do not move 
Cuz I’m already ready there 
Percs make you think you’re at the top
But really you’re just staring at the top 
I am superior 
You’re animosity is expected 
Cuz you are inferior 
My rap game is too cold 
My bars are too fire 
My name is Luke warm 
But you can call me sire
