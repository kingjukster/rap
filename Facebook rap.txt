I hear you listenin, but that doors knocked down
Hands behind our backs, guilty is how we found
Pain and struggle is all we’ve ever known
Forget right or wrong we just wanna go home 

But that’s some place we can never be
The hurricane passed, but here comes another three
We smokin cuz they took everything we aspire 
We’re walking the tightrope they lit on fire
