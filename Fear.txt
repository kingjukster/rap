I lived my childhood in fear
I couldn’t give a fuck if they think I’m queer 
I’m so much bigger than I appear 
I pull up and make your bitch disappear 

Crazy how much death, I’ve looked in the eye
Still didn’t feel a thing, I really wanted to die 
You still don’t understand, I committed the crime 
I wasn’t holding the gun, but I still did the time 

My Rollie watch go tik tok, but I never get on tik tok 
It’s crazy how my Glock hot, every time I pull it back it go click clock 

I keep a running talley, I don’t ever get crossed 
Cuz when I hit four, I make sure it get crossed 
Running a batch a chicken, I make sure the bread tossed 
I’m turning out the lights, I make sure they exhaust
