What’s meant to be is meant to be 
I feel like I’m floating with the forces that be 

Controlling people lives 
Push a man towards the money right off the cliff 
9-5 rinse and repeat so much for what ifs 
There’s is no creativity do this for my kids 
Everything is what it is?
Who told you that, what do they know 
Thinking like that there is no room to grow 
Who told you that, what do they know? 
No change in their life I suppose 
Who told you that, what do they know? 
They tryna hold you back they wanna keep you low 
Getting difficult, to watch all of this 
Hate being right but I do not miss 

You sir are complacent 
I really hate to say it 
Ain’t moving but you racing 
To nowhere, that ain’t cap it’s all facts 
You don’t have to listen to me I’ll send it in a fax 

You don’t have to listen to me 
I’ll still come to collect 
Advice is free 
Last time I checked 
You could be anything you wanted to be 
Once you got your mind set 

Is you gonna let them take your spot 
Does that shit not make you hot?
Light a fire under you pot? 
Is you gonna do something or not?
