Got a gat named it ratatouille 
It can shoot from anywhere like it’s cooking with curry 
And I’ll be the first to stir the pot 
Might call me harden the way I take my shots
I need a fix Dlo
Put that ice in my veins 
They call you AI 
Cuz you answer to me 
And shit I might just be a king 
When you got bron that’s a guaranteed ring 
He ain’t just a shooter when it came time 
Dame time came with the address 
And if you keep reaching 
Kyrie might have to make a mess
