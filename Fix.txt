They say the party never ends
But I’m still searchin’ for my friends
I don’t know where it begins
But I know just where it ends

They always call me I just ghost the phone
Ain’t about no bitch, I’m in my zone
They think I’m rich the way I roll up to the scene
I tell ’em “when in Rome”

But really I just wanna be alone
I’ve seen how vultures circle for the throne
I peep the love, but it don’t feel real
They dap you up just to plot and steal

I move like shadows under moonlit skies
Truth in my chest, but I still wear disguise
Smile on my face, pain behind my eyes
Silence loud, I don’t fake for them guys
