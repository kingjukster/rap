I don’t know why you hate on the things I do
You probably already have a plan brewed 
What can I do to fix this
I’m willing to risk it 
I was just trying to run from the past 
But oh no you couldn’t have that
Now I have to deal with all this backlash 
Cuz you were trying to rewrite the past

That’s just the way things go 
Respectfully fuck you, too
After all I been through 
You was my neighborhood boo
The person I go too 
Respectfully fuck you, too
I don’t need you
All I see is evil 
May heaven not see you
Respectfully fuck you, too
You’re a hassle 
Now I look past you 
Turned the tassel 
Respectfully fuck you, too
Won’t see you anytime soon 
Let’s celebrate new truth 
No need for any proof
