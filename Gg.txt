My two cents is free 
You can pay to win but that won’t make you free 
The power to the People am I in the right country? 
You say you want change but can’t give up that dollar 
It’s a cruel world, you might not judge me for the color my skin but you will for my collar 
My pockets aren’t deep, so that must mean I’m not on fleet, left me in the past, like five years ago 
No time to change, learn to cope, here’s a hoe
If that doesn’t fix ya, I’m have to click the X, Take your blue check, Sorry you’re canceled we won’t miss ya
