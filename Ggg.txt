Body: 
Im alone in the studio with my gun
It don’t really matter what I have done
Cuz I can’t break bread with everyone 
They said different then what they done 

Imma lost boy since my momma lost a boy 
Now I talk shit like my walk inexhaustible 
You better hope it’s not I’ll pitch a balk ya fool
And jump in my money like it’s Mcduck’s pool 


But that’s okay, cuz it’s just me and my gun 
we don’t play, right now it’s fuck everyone 

Please, I don’t treat, bitches and niggas 
Like they a treat, see what I mean 
You a fein, don’t have my sympathy 
Instagram hoes need some Mr T
Pity the thirst and the fake energy
Can’t sip Sprite, they too obsessed with squirtin’
It’s the brand now, fake bougie, barely workin’
They drinkin’ Fiji, tryna flex on the team
But I’m a tap water legend, know what I mean?
Wear it proud, I don’t chase what they seek
Cuz when I tap that ass, I ain’t payin’ a fee

So I been sleeping with my gun 
You thought life sweet but it’s no fun

I’m running out of ground to run 
So I spit until the mic is done 
And then I press that button yea rerun 
Count the shells that pop out my, uhh
I just pray for a better ending 
Lord know I’m hotter than the damn sun 
So you know I can’t stop spending 
Blowing bags like they on land mines
