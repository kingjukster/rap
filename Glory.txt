I have it all 
The riches, the bitches 
The six stitches left by my father 
Goals that seem to get farther 
But I’m blessed?
Or am I stressed?  
From the thoughts in my mind 
But I’m too kind 
To speak these to you 
So they sit in queue 
Waiting for the right time 
To strike in rhyme 
Written in this notepad 
Signed by this undergrad 
Speaks a truth 
So suasive it need no proof
