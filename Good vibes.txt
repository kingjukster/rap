You’re finer than a diamond on a broke girl’s ring.  
I spit game that would make the West Coast sing.  
I’m sorry I’m not, I got million dollar dreams.  
I’m sorry I’m not your mistress, a fiend.  

Heart full of fire, mind full of schemes.  
Eyes on the prize, I’m not what I seem.  
Life ain’t sweet, and you’re not a queen. 
So don’t act royal in a dollar store scene.
