Getting stuck in difficult situations like I’m quagmire 
Pull my dick out this bitch, I only fucked for the satire 
Pernicious on the beat, when I spit it’s always heat 
19 years straight and I haven’t hit my peak, I’m runnin, nothing can stop this streak 
I’m scurrying up the ladder, gone in a flash 
I’m that guy, like the latter, nobody can take off this mask
I’m coming in with the vodka in my orange juice, you could say I got a screw loose
I’m a little crazy playing who’s who, you could find me fitted with a new noose
I got a few views with eyes that are clairvoyant 
This isn’t new news this is my anointment 
I’m kicking my patience out like doctors when they don’t make an appointment 
I’m killing rappers I’m not doing this for the enjoyment 
I’m taking souls go look for new employment
