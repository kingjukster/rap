Body: 
I put myself in a box just to break free
I spent 19 years thinking just to figure out I hate me 
Seems like it’s time for a change 
Spin the block and pick up my change 
I’ve been thinking to hard to fall for mind games 
Whole lotta anger up in my brain 
Wash it away with my pain 
I’m done playing life’s game 

Chorus 


I been thinking hard, what’s life? 
I’ve been spinning in circles, what’s right?

I got my work cut out for me, will I step up 
I’ve been going through the ringer, I got caught up
In the devilish temptation of Mary sublime 
Lost in the sauce of excess
