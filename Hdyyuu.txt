I’m cutting the loaf, I’m done chasing the bread 
What can I say, when there’s nothing to be said 
Life is a bitch and hope is a guess 
Give me some weed and I’ll handle the rest
I guess this is the part where I go off 
The part where I can do no wrong 
The part where I hit the charts with a top ten song 
Within no time I’ll be gone 
Life’s is cold like her sister December 
I been lost since days I can’t remember 
I been searching for something that’s gone
I gotta hope that I’m wrong
