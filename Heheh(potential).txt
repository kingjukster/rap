I’m not a rapper, that just occurred to me 
All my raps are selfish, all about me 
Maybe I should take a new direction, look for something else to see
This is a big world, a whole galaxy 

Niggas fighting, that’s a tragedy 
Resentin the cops, that’s just the black in me 
We talking real talk, smoking on that ganja 
But we don’t gang bang, Negro sobre naranja
