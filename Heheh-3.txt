I play my cars right o
I don’t leak oil, I’m the tower
Like my name is mater 

They call you lethal shooter 
That’s a crazy double entendre 
You a lethal shooter on the court 
From any range 
You a lethal shooter in the streets 
You can find any vein 

I be on the weed 
I be on the drank 
I know I gotta stop 
But I know I caint
Pop up on the Rari 
Then I push the chain 
Dancing with these bitches 
You know life’s a game
