Hey ma just checking in
These people gonna be the death of me
Pressure coming from all directions 
Ain’t no out but a nine to Brian 
That is a before I 
Let me not be so subtle 
It’s enough to take a blade to my vein 
Like I swear to god you won’t take me in vein 
You’ll hear my thoughts it just might have to be on the intercom 
Got no idea how you guys stay so calm 
It hits me in waves like I’m in the ocean 
Volatile like one second I’m coasting 
The next I need a tinfoil hat 
Cuz that paranoia got my mind on the fritz 
Felt like I fell in a pit like it’s pouring out 
That is my brain out my noggin 
Body tired like I’ve been joggin 
And I swear I wanna show y’all 
But I just don’t have anyone to show 
Ain’t wanna say I’m alone but you’ll see when you read the note 
It at too bad tho you’ll find a way to cope 
At least that I hope 
Or you’ll be hear wit me 
In that case I’m not alone
