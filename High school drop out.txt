If I was black I could quit school and rap 
Grab the strap put it up blap and that’s that 
I rap it too you 
I smack it through you 
This shit wack how’d it happen to you 
Speak up just to be ignored 
Speak down just to be misunderstood 
Shits strange the walls moving 
Feel like I’m diving in it 
Stood up and swam through it 
Emerged from it 
A phoenix from the ashes 
Spoke it to it 
Had a fire conversation 
Muy buen fuego 
Conmiga
Topanga
Paradise been there 
Not shit been there 
Burned over hell there 
Hell yea?
Hell yea!
Straight up?
Big faxs 
Big brain did that
