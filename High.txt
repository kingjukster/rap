I can put the words together like a symbol 
If you light the fire under my ass like kindle 
Who knew it all could be this simple
I pop off like a mother fucking pimple 
Put a dent in your ass like some dimples
I go so hard just to destroy your mental 
Aiming my shit straight at your temple 
The time for peace is over, I closed the window 
It’s all over but this ain’t the end tho, (nope)
I’ll send my severed dick in an envo-(lope)
That’s too much they think you psycho, (dope)
They lookin at my brain under a micro-(scope)
