Hopefully 
You’ll be able to see 
I have no more 
Hopefully 
You’ll pretend to be 
My friend 

Where am I 
I been getting high 
It ain’t my fault 
Tell god to quit the assault 
I know he testing me 
But it’s leaving me restless 
I been playing my part 
Tell me when do I get to ball 
I swear to god one day you’re gonna get that call 
I’m not selfish I’m just helpless
