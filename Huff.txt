I got them trip nines
Yea yea
Trip nines 
Yea yea
Then trip nines 
Yea yea
On my left arm
Yea yea 
My left arm 
Yea yea 
My left arm 
Yea yea 

They protect my heart from harm
Yeah yea 
Know how far I’ve come
Yea yea
Tell me right from wrong 
Yea yea 
I’m not too far from gone 
Yea yea

I been living fast fast fast fast
That’s time I can’t get back back back back
So I just tip my hat hat hat hat 
And tell god I’m back back back back

I been in my feelings 
Since I left the zone
A couple more ginlings
And I’m stumblin home 

I’m trippin over the words to make me  known 
Feel like everything I’ve ever loved is already gone 
What a cliché, sitting on my throne, alone
I’m on dnd today but I wish you’d hit my phone 

Easier said then done 
So I guess i gotta get done 
Got a power swing to bat a run 
No rbi, I make my own fun 
Risk a part of the game
So it’s a part of the plan 
I didn’t do it for fame 
I didn’t it for the fam 
I tamed the mane 
Now to tame a man 
We’re not the same
I killed Uncle Sam
