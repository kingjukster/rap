To be honest, I don’t really like where my life is 
I’m tryna figure out, why I only hang around white kids 
My momma don’t like it when i talk this 
But that’s tough luck cuz we gonna talk about this 

I feel like im wasting my days 
I feel like im wasting away 
I feel like literal decay 
I feel like the other fifty shades of grey 
I feel like I might just blow my brains away 

But we don’t get to fade away 
We have to live through it 
The pain our eyes glued to it 
The crucial part we see through it 
My sacrifice takes the floor away 
Bliss I feel half way down 
The air I imagine takes my frown 
The fear I thought ran away 
But I never hit the ground
