How he rap like that 
He kinda fast with his shit 
I’m not wack 
I just happened to be in this shit 
I don’t rap 
It’s for a rack and some shit 
Gas up and spit for the bag I’m playing in the game 
When they call I ball 
I do what I’m told 
And I call for collect 
The only thing I’m running for is your neck
And the only thing chasing me is a check
