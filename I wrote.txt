I wrote this song in my house, thinking about my next wins 
Overshadow my thoughts and I’ll show them your sins 
Get rid of all that extra noise you don’t need 
Succumb to temptations gives a front row seat to the game 
You can pray it away but Luci don’t change 
She jingles, she’ll wish you Merry Christmas and take your father away 
If you overlook her, she’ll take your life away 
Make a deal, you gave your life away
