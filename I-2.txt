I gotta let the ego go
I gotta let the anger go 
I gotta feel, fosho
I was locked up, ain’t no hoe

I gotta lift, gotta be strong
I can’t let go, can’t be wrong
Hiding insecurities in a song 
Hiding tears because I’m strong 

I’m strong like I’m Hercules
I can’t talk unless I’m on the percs to ease 
All the pain 
It come with a lot to gain 
Bitch I am a winner 
Still won’t take my father out to dinner 
X’s on my back they call it a birth mark 
If you aren’t winning they gonna leave a mark 

I gotta let the ego go
I gotta let the anger go 
I gotta feel, fosho
I was locked up, ain’t no hoe

I gotta lift, gotta be strong
I can’t let go, can’t be wrong
Hiding insecurities in a song 
Hiding tears because I’m strong

I gotta let my friends go
I been distant
Not quick to listen
Who am I kidding they let me go 
I been looking around 
It’s real quiet out 
It feels like a nuclear fallout
Ain’t nothing around not even a sound

I gotta let the ego go
I gotta let the anger go 
I gotta feel, fosho
I was locked up, ain’t no hoe

I gotta lift, gotta be strong
I can’t let go, can’t be wrong
Hiding insecurities in a song 
Hiding tears because I’m strong

I gotta escape this prison
No room for decisions 
It’s me against me 
I’m not winning that’s for sure 
Made a mess, of my life 
Whose do I take next
