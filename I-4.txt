I quit smoking again cu I wasn’t smoking to get high 
I was really smoking cuz I missed Kai 
And deep down I knew that shit wasn’t right
I couldn’t go on living that kind of life 


I’m on fire, I’m on fire
Lost my desire, my desire 
You’re the one I admire, I admire 
Lost on my priors, my prior? 

I miss the fire in my soul 
When I had places to go 
Now it all feels so cold 
I fell out of the mold

I remember just a year ago 
We was dancing to till the speaker broke 
Singing till our voices go
Playin Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Grab my heart by the throat 
Once it’s cold let it go 
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe 
See how high it could go
Left my house a week ago 
Lost the key, can’t find my soul 
Now I got all this time alone
Find the wall, I’m in the zone 
Crushed my heart, my feelings known 
Borrow yours, I’ll take a loan 
Gave it back, it’s fake chrome 
Closed off, now my hope is gone
