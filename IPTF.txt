Body: 
I can make a quiet room loud 
That’s why I’m smokin on this cloud 
Cuz I can’t feel my soul right now 

The way I know I’m him nigga 
I’m anointed nigga 
I’m the big stepper 
You can’t step to me 
Promethazine 
Step back and let it heave 
Y’all niggas can’t mess with me 
Y’all niggas can’t get the best of me 
Y’all niggas cant touch this shit 
I locked up the recipe 
Y’all niggas can’t stop this shit 
It’s destiny
I been on top for so long 
There’s no one next to me 
Y’all niggas in ya feelings over a bitch 
You needa start thinkin on a theory like Wesley 
Cuz I know damn well there would be no rest for me 
Till I get em back show them what it’s like to get the best from me  
Sike nigga you can get half of that 
You’re gonna have to wind it back 
If you wanna know why is that 

How did we get here?
It started as a flower of Motivation X
In Unity I found home like the warrior nation
Leadership kept it strong 
For that to work Trust was needed 
To get that Respect was earned 
To hold it all together was Communication X

But really I’m tryna communicate some motivation 
Cuz I got the people in unity
That’s what leadership do when you buy into the causation 
Trust come after respect between you and me
And I know you smart, don’t gotta spell it out
You know he pity a fool when Mr T pop out
So let’s not talk on 360, let’s get real 
You nothing without me, it’s not an insult just cuz it don’t appeal
Take the magnifying glass off, let’s get to the deal
You’re shell shocked but still behind the wheel 
Reminiscing on some Kanye when he lifted the heil 
But you gonna have to lock in, this isn’t the last verse 
This glass isn’t half full, it’s empty nigga 
You gonna have to focus up and start thinking bigga
One person isn’t a crutch, it’s a curse 
I’m not pitching you the bigger picture
I’m pitching you the frame nigga 
You gonna have to let go of that disdain nigga
It’s addictive like cocaine nigga 
You blow your nose and wipe out your brain nigga 
On channel 2 like damn that’s a shame nigga 
All the while we all playin the same game nigga
You get what I’m sayin? N….no
