I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself 
I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself 

I feel like it’s going wrong 
I feel like I’m running out of songs 
I feel like the end is near 
I feel like I shouldn’t be here 
I feel like one pull away 
I feel like I’m one knot away 
I feel like I’m not enough 
I feel like I don’t do enough 
I feel like I have this feeling 
I feel like I can’t shake this feeling 
I feel like I’m not healing 
I feel like the ceiling it’s spinning 
I feel like walking but not moving 
I feel like everything but winning 
I feel like my breathe is thinning 
I feel like the point is missing 

I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself 
I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself 

I try to distract myself 
I can’t stop myself 
I throw myself 
Into my friends 
Hoping it ends 
But it never does 
One after another and then another one 
I don’t know hell sounds fun 
Maybe I pull out this gun 
Maybe I drown in this rum 
I don’t want to see the sun 
It’s over it’s done 
But it’s never finished 
Excuse me if I’m a little skittish 
Last I checked the glass was half empty 
Might as well use that rope god sent me 


I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself 
I want to kill myself 
Kill myself 
Kill myself
