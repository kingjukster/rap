Big 14, I’m rolling 9s, that’s my culture
No real love, I’m stepping on her heart
What that mean? MC T, I invented it 
Lost my soul, smoking till I can find it 
Big 14, I’m rolling 9s, that’s my culture
No real love, I’m stepping on her heart
What that mean? MC T, I invented it 
Lost my soul, smoking till I can find it

After I fuck up, I tell my bitch that I need her
But that’s not before, I make her knees hurt
I can’t risk losing her, she’s a keeper 
She just wanna trust me, I swear I’ll make it happen
Walk into the building
And pour out my feelings, just to start the healing, I know
The devil with you, he chattin 
Dont listen to the cappin, don’t give up on the passion, I know
My eyes on the future 
3 years down and I’m pulling to the home stretch 
Grab my hand we can put it to the test (yeah, yeah)
When we are together we’re nothing short of the best (yeah, yeah)
I’d put my life on the line
Can you hear that? I just told the world that you’re mine 
We don’t gotta argue every time I tell you that I’m fine
Cuz you can see it every time I write a rhyme

Big 14, I’m rolling 9s, that’s my culture
No real love, I’m stepping on her heart
What that mean? MC T, I invented it 
Lost my soul, smoking till I can find it 
Big 14, I’m rolling 9s, that’s my culture
No real love, I’m stepping on her heart
What that mean? MC T, I invented it 
Lost my soul, smoking till I can find it
