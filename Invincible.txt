Nigga I’m title card
When I attack the beat, it’s always hard 
I might just drop a feat, then disappear for a week 
And come back with the hardest bars

I’m outta this world 
I went to mars university, I specialize in adversity 
Open my diary it’s a verse you’ll see

I popped out the womb with a pen in hand 
A whole lotta anger and a detailed plan 
These words are my weapons and I’m running you over 
Drop a verse on your head that’s vernacular murder
