You know that voice in your ear 
That one calling you baby, like come here 
Like she didn’t mean it like that, right 
Prolly not, but shit she might
It’s a verbal fist fight, in my head 
Quite literally got me, dead 
What is there left to be said 
I just need to relax,
go find me a bed 

It’s a lot to be done 
Don’t quit and ruin the fun 
I can do it all, might just wake up and grab the sun 
They say it couldn’t be done 
Well now I’ve done it and they just want to see another one 
Tell me, when have I won
They got me on the run
Like yo ass is done 

What have I become 
A product of them 
Like a tree I stem 
From their greed 
It’s that anything to succeed
I’m talking money lies times three 
Make a deal with the devil, I got my own trickery 
Cause I have all these people 
Tryin feed on me 
Like god damn, what it take to get some common decency
