ITS BEEN A LONG DAY IN THE OFFICE
A lot of things could be the trending TOPIC
I feel SMALL MICROSCOPIC
NOW A DAYS
HOLIDAYS IN THE closet
Panic attacks
Might have lost it 
Lost IN A CAVE
LIKE A HOBBIT
Need some rest
Lost all my LOGIC
EVERYTHING AROUND ME
Left FROM IT


Verse 1

I COULD WRITE THE BOOK
WOULD THEY EVEN READ
Is there really a POINT
Caught up in my greed
What do I WANT?
IS IT WHAT I NEED?
TWO times you aight?
LIKE no my ego needs to feed
IN LIFE
Feelings make you bleed
You can try to sing 
You can try to plead 
It won’t solve the problem
It won’t make you succeed 
Life is such a chore
Nothing is guaranteed 
Life’s one big long trial
BUT DO THEY NOTICE?
Took the blue pill
Lost MY FOCUS
Can’t catch UP
Am I HOPELESS
Filled with JEALOUSY 
Everything PROVOKEs US
DREAMS OF freedom       
Somebody take notice 
My thoughts keep ME AT HOME
They make me breathless 
It’s hard FOR ME
My life BOGUS
None of it COUNTED
Nobody to hold us
SOMETIMES ITS me against ME
AND NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
Thinks like me
WE GOT DIFFERENT THOUGHTS
Mine are caged they’re not free
One of THESE DAYS
Imma find the key

Verse 2

I can’t believe 
I can’t believe 
I’m trying to level
I’m trying GRIEVE
I have some PROBLEMS
ROLLing UP my SLEEVES
I NEED some help man
Quickly please 
I’m falling might slip
My feelings won’t leave 
These things TAKE TIME
But fuck that I’m trying to leave
BUT YOU KNOW
I GOT PET PEEVE..
Talking about your feelings, even partly
PLEASE LEAVE
EXIT
It’s not personal I’m just an artist
Ironic I suppose 
I’m not THE SHARPEST
LIFE A SONG PLAY ALONG
LIKE you’re the artist
SOME FAKE MELODIES
I’m in the wrong market
With the wrong tools 
This job is the hardest
The order is tall
Can’t find the target 
Stumbling OFF AIM
And missed THE TARGET
Let’s call it a defeat
Can we just stop it 
Why am I trying STILL
This sums it up
Everything’s going DOWN HILL
I TOOK THE BLUE PILL
I’m only mortal
LIVE AND die on this hill
