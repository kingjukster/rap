Body: 
They say pressure makes a diamond 
But I think that they are lyin 
Cuz all this pressure made a lion
And it’s got all the mothers cryin 
And I hang my pride on my mane
I always tell em it ain’t a thing 
Knowing damn well it’ll never be the same 
Need a deep dive inside of my brain  
To realease this trama behind my name 
Who is Terrell? The next Tupac 
Saint Peter, who’s who and who’s not 
Pearly gates looking fire engine red 
Wondering where I’d be once I’m dead
Who is Terrell? The next Charlie 
Absent from reality, with feelings of sincerity 
A wallflower at every party, existing just barely 
Who is Terrell? The next Jarad 
Turn his emotions to something sacred 
So he can learn to make it 
The immortal demigod, save him
He popped the perc and it ate him
Ahem, okay then, we can’t save him

The hard part is showing you me 
I’m one to always compete 
Poker face in the face of defeat 
I’m throwing hooks like you wouldn’t believe 
I got an unlimited supply like water in the sea
Deeper bag then the Mariana 
Ain’t nobody workin harder
Hardest drop since the Carter 
Carter 6 we’re going farther 
Farthest yet we hit the target 
Target checked we a sold out artist
Farthest yet? Thats just a marker 
Working hard I’m working smarter 
Not tired yet, just hit the mile marker
Actin an ass in called it the answer 
That’s a mild threat, to my Peter Parker
