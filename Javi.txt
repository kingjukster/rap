I can see you called but I declined
I put my phone on dnd, yea 
I’m sorry, I’m fine
I know you miss the energy 
But I’m tired this time 
I always show the friend in me
But not this time, no
I’m primed to go so ballistically 
It’s me vs me
And I’m losing the war inside my mind
Places I go can’t be found




I think I might have gone insane 

So many fleeting thoughts through my brain

What are you doing in the moment of magnitude 
I’m talking richter 
You really gotta drop all of that attitude 
And get the picture 
But I’m not above batting my eyes at you 
Just to hit ya 
My father text me back saying “I’m missing you”
Quit your bitchin

I ain’t care what you missing 

You’re sadistic,
