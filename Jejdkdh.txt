Body: 
Nappy dreaded light skin 
Walking through town at a cool 73 
He boils over too quickly 
Say the wrong thing, raise to 93 
With a counterweight side piece Hopes to keep the peace 
Like, calm down, we got places to be 
He’s not worth it give me the keys 
He a power hungry nigga 
There’s potential to see 
Intelligent thinker with shallow pockets and a Carmel voice
