Her momma caught me in the nookie and pulled out the moccasin
Screaming and hollering while I put my tip in 
Threw it and knocked a nigga down like a mother fucking cop gun 
Knocked me out the sky before I could shoot like I never watched top gun
Parents hate me like the north hates slavery
I been knocking down daughters like that pussy was made for me
Sweet talking till I bust a load, I ain’t picky, what’s a bro code
Getting head on the road, I’m in a different lane, a different mode
