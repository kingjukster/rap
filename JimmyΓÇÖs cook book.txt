Have you ever seen someone’s lights go out ?
Jimmy got cooked and that’s not alright 
Makes you really think are you living life right
Are you living in the moment, or is your mind out of sight ?
Can you see your blessings?
Look deep, do you see yourself 
Can you reflect or is that what a mirror does? 
Do you live for yourself or the greater cause?
Do you take it personal or build on it?
Do you want to move forward or be complacent 
Can you look death in the eyes and face it 
Would you take a bullet for Mr Morale or are you baseless
Jimmy looking rough, a little corrupt 
Jimmy not living life right 
Jimmy left right 
Jimmy never died, jimmy never was alive 

A black man living tall, now that’s a threat 
Police knocking down doors , guess who’s the suspect 
Thirty cop  cars  for a dwi 
Everybody makes it out, except you and I 

Ain’t no black hero’s in the ghetto 
You get close, slip and catch the metal
Young niggas running fast to make it out 
How come nowadays everywhere feel like the south

Jimmy got cooked for cooking the books 
Stepping on toes, get you to the end, like that’s all she wrote 
Looney toon broke, like that’s all folks
Truth always comes to collect its debt 
That’s one deal you might wanna second guess 
But that’s besides the point, be yourself 
Can’t think of one reason to quit, here’s three or four 
I’m done talking, no more back and forth 
I’ve said a lot and they not even listenin 
I might as well stop rapping before this verse even finished 
Take note, heed my words , this ain’t for an image 
Live life right, let go of the privilege 
Tupac spoke up, he tried to tell us 
Ignore what’s in front of you, they tryna sell us 
Now we hidin in the shadows, life is scary 
Judas and the black messiah, I am a revolutionary 

A black man living tall, now that’s a threat 
Police knocking down doors , guess who’s the suspect 
Thirty cop  cars  for a dwi 
Everybody makes it out, except you and I 

Ain’t no black hero’s in the ghetto 
You get close, slip and catch the metal
Young niggas running fast to make it out 
How come nowadays everywhere feel like the south
