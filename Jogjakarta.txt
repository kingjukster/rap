Body: 
I feel cold 
I feel sad
I feel desperate 
I feel in need 
I really don’t want to 
Do anything 
I can’t have fun 
Not right now 
You can’t say 
It gets better 
It does but it isn’t 
I want to sit and stare 
I do not have a care 

OH MY GOD
I WANT TO SCREAM 
KICK AND YELL 
ANYTHING TO TELL, HOW I FEEL 
THIS IS SOMETHING I CANT APPEAL 
IT DOESNT CHANGE 
I REALLY JUST WANT TO RAGE 
I FEEL BOXED INTO A CAGE 
WHAT I DID TO DESERVE THIS 
A GOOD AMOUNT OF PAIN 
CAUSED BY A LOT OF DENIAL 
I KILLED RELATIONSHIPS WITHOUT TRYING 
NOT TRYING LEFT ME IN DISBELIEF 
HOW COULD MY KARMA CATCH UP WITH ME 
IM NOT INVINCIBLE 
MY ABILITY TO CONVINCE 
CREATED A PATH TO PARADISE 
JUST NOT FOR ME 
IT WAS THE THOUGHT 
OF SELF PRESERVATION 
I SENT MY FEELINGS ON VACATION 
AND I ROSE TO THE OCCASION 
I TOOK OVER 
I CONTROLLED THE ROOM 
POSTPONING MY DOOM 
IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I LOST CONTROL 
IT LEFT ME BROKEN AND DERANGED 
IM A PUZZLE PUT ME BACK TOGETHER
