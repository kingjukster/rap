Body: 
Just spun a niggas block, wiped a niggas nose 
He looking for a rat, but I sprayed him with his hoes
They stabbed him in the back, but that’s how life goes 
Now I got a target on my back, but it’s all fosho (for show)

Fucked a nigga up, making enemies 
All my niggas fucked up, chemically 
Just to prove a point
Take a nigga out, Viciously 
I give niggas misery, I eliminate niggas from history 
I mean it differently when I say you’re dead to me 

I couldn’t give a fuck about a face 
I couldn’t give a fuck about a body 
I can give a fuck about a soul 
Cuz that’s how you know somebody
