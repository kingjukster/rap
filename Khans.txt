I been living outside my range 
I gotta take care of my brain 
I had to swerve lanes 
To much time in the fast lane 
Done rotted my brain 
I forgot where I came 
From, I been disrespecting the first to respect
Me, they built me up set the bar of what to expect 
I gotta focus up theirs a lot in front of me 
I gotta choose right, can’t succumb to the, 
Temptation to take everything 
Flying high means flying free 
But modesty means being healthy 
Lost a lot of friends chasing high 
Won them back living life
