Driving with my knees, while I’m rolling the blunt 
I be doin it with ease, while I’m smoking on skunk
The secret to it be, don’t overcomplicate, be blunt
When it comes to me, I can be whatever I want
Pockets fat, that is cap, make it back
We be bad, going out sad, run it back
Soul searchin, soul surfing, throw it back 
holes hurtin, hoes hurtin, want it back
