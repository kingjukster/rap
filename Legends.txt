They say legends never die 
But where’d all my niggas go 
All the legends gone fading away 
It makes it hard to believe in god 
When he’s taking all my people away 
I know he all knowing but how do you justify juice 
You can say it’s the percs but then how do you justify Kobe 
There’s a whole list it goes on and on 
I don’t understand 
They had so much more to give
