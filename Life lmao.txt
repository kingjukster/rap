I lived life for what it is 
Did I get what I deserved
I don’t know maybe 
Played the hand I was dealt
But the cards were bent 
Everybody saw my hand 
I never had a chance
They saw it coming from the start 
Put me right back to the beginning sleeping on a bench in the park 
I had dreams I had a plan 
But I can’t stand...


Oh what does it matter 
You’ve heard what you’ve heard 
You’ve seen what you’ve seen 
Put the fucking book down 
It doesn’t get better from here 
That’s something they tell you 
So you continue to do what they tell you 
And what the fuck are you doing 
Still reading? 
Didn’t I tell you to put the book down 
You’re a little stubborn aren’t you 
That’s good you’ll go places 
You’re like a beautiful forest 
And yes your life’s on fire 
But a forest has to burn to be able to grow 
And people will let you burn 
Until you get too close 
When you get close they’ll put you out 
People don’t want to see you grow 
They don’t care 
What they care about is themselves 
And when you’re interfering with them something has to be done 
And that’s not even what I can’t stand 


Well if you’ve read this far you might as well finish 
I can’t hand you everything 
You have to think for yourself 
Don’t tell me you’re not a forest 
Tell me you understand
