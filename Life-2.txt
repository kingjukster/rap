Fuck living
Imma drown in my sorrow 
I won’t last till tomorrow 
Ain’t nobody see the tears I hide 
Ain’t nobody see these feelings I hide 
Let me sit in this corner and cry 
Stuck in this box can’t find no way out 
You say it’s the the devils work but I don’t think you wanna find out 
This shits over my head 
I’m drowning in a sea of my own sins 
I’d pray for a savior but when has the lord been in favor 
Forgive and forget when it comes down to it you forget to forgive 
Now nigga I don’t know what to do 
The waters rising what the fuck do I do 

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO 
WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO 
WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO
