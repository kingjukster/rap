I’m not a rapper, I’m a lyricist 
The difference between me and your favorite hero is 
I’m not trying to save you, I’m trying to make you feel better then 
Your last nigga did, I’m for real baby I’ll pay dividends 
You got a lot of troubles, I’m tryna take that off
I got you another bottle, do you wanna top that off
We can finish it later, if you wanna talk right now 
You start, I’ll listen, tell me how 
Your day went, all the details, tell me how 
You feel and what you want now 
I’m here for you baby, you just gotta speak up
I’m just…

Lost in the sunshine that is your eyes 
Every time I see you, it’s a new surprise 
My feelings for you, got me flying high
Surfing the waves , on cloud nine 
I like you baby, let the sparks fly
You and me forever, I want that 
I want that , I want that 

I got your text, I already hit back 
I wanna see you , where your crib at
We can slide to mine, or rent a room 
It don’t matter to me, if I see you soon 
This is the start, of something great
I brought drinks, so we can celebrate 
This is our night, let’s make it special
You play the angel, I’ll play the devil 
Write some sins, and baby I’ll collect them 
I got some goals, you can be next in 
As my girlfriend, you and me 
Forever, I’m just…

Lost in the sunshine that is your eyes 
Every time I see you, it’s a new surprise 
My feelings for you, got me flying high
Surfing the waves , on cloud nine 
I like you baby, let the sparks fly
You and me forever, I want that 
I want that , I want that
