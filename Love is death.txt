I love you to death 
I swear to god I’d put you before him 
But I can’t help it
When I’m around you I keep my distance because I don’t wanna be held liable 
For all that bullshit your niggas be saying 
And when you make me mad I just wanna drop off the face of the earth 
I just wanna be gone and pull myself away 
Shove myself into a box so you can’t make me feel some type of way 
And each time I catch my self before it’s too late 
But it’s got me wondering what happens when i don’t make it 
Will you be able to take it 
Or did I fuck up and you’re asking why 
I’ll tell you why because god knows I’m doing it for you 
I put myself in this cage so I can’t hurt you
If I can’t reach you I can’t be mad at you 
Is that selfish I don’t know probably 
And that’s why when you ask if I’m okay it’s hard to answer honestly
