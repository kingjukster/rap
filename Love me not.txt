It feels like she loves me 
But she loves me not 
I don’t know when the insanity started 
But I know it won’t stop 
Imma goner regardless 
There’s no hope 
I take meds 
It’s how I cope 
I don’t know why it’s so appealing 
Darkness looks so clean 
I don’t know when it started 
But I’m addicted to lean 
Life’s a bitch and I can’t break her 
She’s a heart breaker, a doomsday maker 
But it’s okay I’ll survive 
Got some angels on my side 
The devil didn’t take to kindly to that 
He reminded me of the fact 
That we signed a contract
