You used to say you in love
I used to say that shit back
Taking that shit from the heart
Now look where the fuck where we at
Girl you got me, just going out bad
Love scars, you got me real sad
Lookin like you had a past
I was hoping that shit was gon' last, oh

I used to say that I was in love 
But I didn’t even know what that shit was
I was fighting for something I couldn’t see 
I was mad at you for things I couldn’t be 
Shot the messenger in the knee 
I’m a sinner Jesus Christ can’t save me 
I’m a sinner Jesus Christ save me 

I been lost for a minute, minute 
I need some help, god send it, send it 
Looking for a sign, but the windows tinted 
Reminiscing about the times I was up in it 
I was a sailor baby, had you finished finished 
I was fishing for your love, I miss it 
I missed it, I came up short, I bricked it 
Shout out December, it’s the coldest 
Lost my hope, she retrieved it 
Loveless, I am the brokest 

You used to say you in love
I used to say that shit back
Taking that shit from the heart
Now look where the fuck where we at
Girl you got me, just going out bad
Love scars, you got me real sad
Lookin like you had a past
I was hoping that shit was gon' last, oh
