I hate you, I’m lost, I need your favor 
My heart is black, that’s your fault, I have no savior 
All them years, who woulda thought, she’d leave ya 
I’m not weak, I have strong thoughts, I don’t need ya 
Can’t you see, you caused all this pain, you’re the weak one 
I don’t need to listen, I’ve heard enough, you can’t teach me 
I’d rather die, than look at you again, all that weakness 
I’m a product of my past, sad and evil, where does that leave us? 
My first instinct is to be mad, but I know that’s not right, why can’t I see this?
 Some things don’t change, and we’re one of them, why do we do this 
It’s time to meet a friend, Luci is particular, he’ll be pleased to meet ya
