Body: 
All them nights you laid awake praying 
Asking god for a path to forgiveness 
Your words don’t fall on deft ears 
Pray to Luci and you too can repent your sins 
Luci will teach you how to hate your father 
When all else seems lost Luci will pick you up 
And all Luci asks in return is a dollar
