Body: 
I’m in the club scouting the floor 
Looking for a bad bitch, a real dime 
Something special, something I can call mine 
That’s when she caught my eyes, what a score
Time to put the plan in action, I’m a man of action 
These feelings she catchin, all I’m doin is actin 
Her body I’m trackin, I pull up what’s happenin
I’m chillin, I’m chattin, she don’t know what’s happenin
I’m a smooth criminal and she a beautiful victim 
Oh you like long walks on the beach,me too 
She fallling for the system 
You like Olivia Rodrigo too
She think she in love, that’s a symptom 
I’m working my magic like a young tmac
She had a nigga, I took his spot, he seem mad
I sent her flowers with an ILY cuz I mean that

Now we’re locked in, the start feels surreal
Honeymoon phase, emotions we both feel
Every day’s a dream, her smile lights my way
We’re deep in the moment, no clouds, just rays
Date nights, long talks, we’re vibin’ so strong
Feels like forever, nothing could go wrong
She’s calling me perfect, the man of her dreams
Caught in a fantasy, everything’s as it seems
But slowly I’m slipping, the cracks start to show
The man she thinks she knows begins to plateau
I’m less attentive, my mask starts to fade
The love we built feels like it’s misplaced
The compliments lessen, I’m pulling away
Her questions get louder, I’ve got nothing to say
The facade is crumbling, she’s starting to see
That the man she fell for was never truly me

She blowing up my phone, I had to delete that 
She want me so bad but that’s too bad 
She too clingy, I don’t really need that 
She yelling and cussing, going out so sad 
Be calling me names like bastard and jerk 
Yelling at me about how much she hurt 
She say I ho around to much, she call me a flirt 
But what can I say, I’m a bastard and a jerk
She say I’m not the same, I changed who I am 
She fell in love with a scam, I learned this from Uncle Sam
This was always the plan, I was never the man
I could always stand, but never understand 
Now she crying herself to sleep 
Like a young widow, all she does is weep
She really thought I was the one keep 
But taming me is a price tag, far too steep
