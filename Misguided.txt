All I ever wanted to fucking do was make my fucking music 
Well now I fucking do it, well yea I fucking blew it 
Yea I’m going fucking through it, yes you fucking knew it 
Yea you told me, so what? Fucking sue me 
I’m sorry, that’s the old me, the new me wouldn’t do it 
Hardly, Im triple og , battle tested through it 
Yea I’m under the influence, on that same shit that I been doing 
Yea I been stewing, yuno when I put my mind to it 
I put my pen to it, yea I can hear the music 
Shit singing in my ear, telling me what I don’t fear 
It’s boutta be a nigga moment, if he try to push up on it 
I’ll hit fifth gear, and start swinging on it 
I’ll let it fly, and tell the judge I own it 
I’ll leave a nigga in the dirt, with his legs broken, and his whip stolen 
While I’m cruising around with his hoe trollin
Like yea we rollin, what you gonna do in the moment 

It go:  need to replace 
boom boom bop, yea that’s what I thought 
Bing bing bap, you out grew that 
Ding ding di, you out grew me 
Mi mi mi, mi mi mi
Mi mi mi, mi mi mi
Well I’ll be damn, you weren’t fucking lying 
I guess it was me, I’m fucking misguided 

Used to use you, now I use it 
Used to know some bad people, now I knew em
Used to use drugs, now I need it 
Para-Fer-NeilYa (Paraphernalia)
Wish it…make me…dissa-peara (disappear) 
Dog it’s me I’m not feeling 
Fuck all that healing 
Like man’s best friend without the K 
to my head I’m disappearing 



They say I’m misguided, I miss guidance? 
Are you what god did, are you miss guidance?
Truthfully, I’m more of water guy, can I see, Mr trident?
Honestly, I’ve been lying, full face, I’ve been hiding
Imma be real this time, Right words at the wrong time
I meant everything you’re mine, we’ll be fine with time
I just gotta tell father I came home 
I have to let my feelings be known 
I was fucked up on my throne, all alone
Doing 120 on the highway in the zone
Got your number typed in on my phone 
I was hallucinating chrome all in my dome
I ain’t trust niggas, pull out the feather and dust niggas 
I am niggas
Look at me, in my eyes, Feel me breathe, watch me cry
Understand, that I’ll die, but not before, I say goodbye

Used to use you, now I use it 
Used to know some bad people, now I knew em
Used to use drugs, now I need it 
Para-Fer-NeilYa (Paraphernalia)
Wish it…make me…dissa-peara (disappear) 
Dog it’s me I’m not feeling 
Fuck all that healing 
Like man’s best friend, without the K,
to my head I’m disappearing
