Not a day goes by where I don’t miss you 
It’s honestly not possible to forget you 
And sometimes it’s hard to live 
With what you did 
And what I did 
But shit I’m here and that’s a blessing in itself 
But that doesn’t help my mental health 
So I hide behind my friends and this skin 
That I call my own 
But it doesn’t feel right like it’s not my home 
I can’t understand how this could happen to me 
I guess I was focused on the amenities 
It seemed so simple to me 
You plus me equaled happy 
But a wall came in and that made three
I guess that makes me the odd one out 
Retracing my steps what the fuck happened 
When did I get this insane 
It feels like part of me loves you and part of me not 
I can’t sit here and rot 
I don’t understand what happened 
One day I was laughin now I’m cracking
