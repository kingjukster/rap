Thinking of love 
got me in a Missouri state of mind
Damn baby got me in my feelings 
In my Missouri state of mind 

Pull up to your crib, call you 
You say you on your way 
Sitting on your door step feeling some sorta way 
The door opened 
In heaven I thought I was 
Speaking all backwards like I was yoda 
But you didn’t seem to notice 
Following you down the hall 
Checking you out all the way 
Girls a baddie and she knows it 
Sat down on the bed with a joint she rolled it 
I looked her in the eyes and said 

Damn baby got me in my feelings 
In my Missouri state of mind 
Thinking of love 
Got me in a Missouri state of mind 

He pulled up to my crib and called me 
I told him I was on my way 
He was sitting on my doorstep 
I could tell he was feeling some sorta way 
I opened the door 
He looked like he was in heaven 
Speaking all twisted like he forget how to talk
I pretended not to notice 
I lead him down the hall
I could tell he was checking me out the entire way
He thought I was a baddie and I knew it 
Laid on the bed with a joint I rolled it 
He looked me in the eyes and said 

Damn baby got me in my feelings 
In my Missouri state of mind 
Thinking of love 
Got me in a Missouri state of mind
