Run into the room and you know what it is 
Pockets out and hands up 
Take you for everything you got and then some 
Take yo bitch your daughter and some 
You can have em back when your money up 
Cuz I’ll be back when yo money up rinse and repeat 
Pull out with the rari and the boujee ass seat 
Stroll through your city 
All your niggas stocking 
But I’m the king now restock 
Got all y’all niggas runnin for me 
Reppin the chain man you know what it is 
You a goblin and I’m the goblin king  
Blinged out with my championship ring 

Pull up to the next city
Building me an empire 
Looking at the horizon 
But I’m beyond that 
Not from earth I’m a Martian 
Hanging with my outer space goons 
With a swag you’d kill for
