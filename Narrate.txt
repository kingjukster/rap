This isn’t new to him 
This is new to you 
This is a series of distinct wrong choices 
Brought on by none other than himself 
An ego cannot go unchecked 
A pattern can be drawn 
From the Talley of his latest victims 
AKA the newest loves of his life 
He truly believes he is doing good 
And in a way he is 
He is teaching our young adults what red flags look like 
It’s never to late or to early to step away 
At first it seems like a pleasant invitation
A perfect dream to lull your future away 
And to his credit it does feel like a dream 
And being a dream you feel comfortable 
Comfort ever reaching, never reached 
Like every clock, he falls back around
And what felt like a dream became a nightmare 
The claws are too deep, you’re caught in his web 
You can no longer speak out, everything’s in your head 
The last one to try and leave was found dead
