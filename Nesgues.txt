Niggas say I ain’t got a rap voice but listen to beags
I don’t know what to tell you, go climb a tree and smoke on a leaf 
You trippin over deez, leave the nuts in the tree 
we both on the outside staring in 
But I’m over here with a fucking grin 
You over there letting me sit it on your chin 
I’ll shove a cob of corn up your ass and throw you in the pig pin
I’m bbqing yo ass , I’m cooking you and your friends 
This ain’t a rap battle, this a career that begins and one that ends



Cm beags, flow broker then his jumper 
Ain’t fuck no bitches but still tryna hump her 
Three song ep, I threw it in the dumpster 
Studio in the closet, hiding like a monster 
Talkin bout bitches and totin’ a nine 
No bars and the flow is a crime 
(You need to practice, put in the time)
Slow head like your misspelling Brian 
You the weakest rapper since six nine
