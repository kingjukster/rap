Niggas faker then flour in a powder bag
They always asking for favors 
But when it’s time for them to return that shit
They done got Amnesia 
Talking bout They don’t owe you shit 
Them niggas trust is like god it don’t exist
They on yo hip talking on some shit 
Like nigga I’m day one 
Nah nigga you ain’t one 
You hopped this wagon when I was something 
But when I was nothing
You were acting like an ill nigga 
Like you didn’t fuck with my kind
Now you saying that you are my kind 
What gives nigga we are not the same 
I’m Thor and you Loki 
I’m the man 
You just pretending 
You faker then the news man 
You one sided just like them 
Talking like you were in the right
Nah nigga you were the left 
You came from the deep like the Loch Ness 
Now behind you comes the apocalypse 
you are the heart of darkness 
I don’t really believe in destiny 
But sometimes I feel like you were put in this world just to fuck with me 
And that’s some messed up shit 
Some nigga in the cosmos playing chess 
While I’m playing checkers with you 
So with these last lines of this verse 
Let me rehearse 
We ain’t good no more 
You seen the last of me 
And imma be saying that till the day I die
