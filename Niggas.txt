And I swear to fucking god 
If I ain’t have so much to live for 
I’d pull that thing back 
And blast it 
Like “what the fuck I got to live for” 
Niggas pressin like they ain’t been there before 
Like your girl ain’t a whore 
Three kids one sixteen, seven, and four 
But you haven’t seen them since Christmas 
When it comes to hittin you can’t miss 
When it comes to talking you try to sneak diss
