And they ain’t like what I was telling them
’Cause my skin chalk full of melanin
But that’s okay, ‘cause I’m heaven-sent
So excuse me when I pop my collar, make ’em jealous then
I earned this every time I showed my soul was fearless
I was always real about what the deal is
So keep off my soul if you ain’t bringing healing
Otherwise, I get to dealing—like Weezy, baby, I got no ceiling

[Verse 1]
I was raised from an apple tree
Fruits of labor, now it’s all I see
Now I live under a money tree
Grass the greenest, but the snakes move subtly
I don’t mow the lawn—don’t give out grass for free
I box it to-go like I’m serving Applebee’s
That’s a please—no ops for me
I pack ’em up and smoke ’em, a dime a piece
So excuse me if I get jealous
My walk’s been real, my heart rebellious
I showed the world what fearless is
And never once did I beg forgiveness
I earned it, yeah, I earned it
From the roots of where I started
From the apple tree to the money garden
I’m still here, and that’s the hardest

I was always real about what the deal is
So keep off my soul if you ain’t bringing healing

[Verse 2]
911, what’s the emergency?
This shit worse than a burglary
Like Father Time in your ovaries
I hit hard, you won’t get over me
Pain in waves like grey and black
I felt like I might not make it back
Wastin’ days, decayin’ fast
Still I breathe, still I last
Fuck god, my niggas been godly
Got me through hell, now I’m movin’ off calmly
Thought you was nothin’ without me, I was wrong, B
Truth is, I’m nothin’ without my posse
Ain’t an insult, that’s honesty
Y’all a part of me—blood or not, it’s family
