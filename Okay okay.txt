I know money can’t buy happiness 
But I can’t stop looking 
I got lost in the attractiveness 
My momma won’t hug me
She say boy you lost your soul 
It really do hurt me 
You need to come home 
Relieve that burden 

But I can’t come home 
I’m too uncertain 
Walk round the world
I’m soul searchin
She rock my world 
But I’m still hurtin
I’m on my knees 
Was it worth it 

Well I can tell you one thing 
I’m worth it, and that’s on gang 
If I spit bars, you know they sang 
Cuz I’m straight up, perfect 
My scars look like smiles 
Turning me up, as simple as a dial 
Turning me off, is sort of a trial 
I’ll take a hand to help me up 
I’m not an object, you can’t pass me off

I feel like my time might have run its course 
And that’s okay I’ve gone down lonely roads before 
But this feels like something else
So I want you to know your son loves you and always has 
And never forget what we had 



One thing for certain, he’ll close the curtain 
My momma hurtin, cuz I’m not learnin
She think I’m with devil, and she’s not wrong 
I’m Billie Jean crazy, in a mj song
