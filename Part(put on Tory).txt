Part of me wants to kill everybody I see 
Part of me hates everything I be 
You and I are not the same, that took some time to see 
I hate everything you are 
Everything you stand for 
I don’t know what to tell you 
There is nothing you can sell me 
I’m coming to collect your debt 
You were born in this world 
I was constructed 
The devil had a plan, he instructed me
Kill everything you see
Hate everything they be 
Feel the pain and you will see 
They ain’t like you 
They don’t fight like you 
They ain’t hurt like you 
They don’t look like you
