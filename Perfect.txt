I don’t rap I just speak the truth 
Through you my feelings exude 
I use the mic as an open mic 
A group therapy session 
We working through all the beef and repercussions 
Hit the percussion all my feelings rushin 
Through my mind got a lot going a lotta ways 
don’t have just one place to stay 
I can not understand why you stay 

You make me feel some type of way 
You take all the pain away 
Without you I might just pass away 

Few years gone? What is life without a tidal wave 
Something to break the sun away 
You thought every day was a happy day 
Nah bitch today it’s a rainy day 
It’s going hard god must be angry today 
I don’t know what to say except ect take the pain away 
It’s getting real dark Imma need some paint today 
Brighten the picture before it fades away 

I can’t feel any type of way 
I need you to take the pain away 
I might just pass away
