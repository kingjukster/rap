Dear god 
Where do I begin 
I miss the times when I didn’t think harder then I played 
Now it’s hard to stay 
In a positive mind set 
Please help me 
Cuz I can scream till my voice get raspy 
And my throat get scratchy 
But It won’t change it 

How can I sit here and think 
I’m on the edge, at the brink 
of extinction
In that is my brain cells 

How can you let me suffer 
You know my pain makes anger 
Yet you give no buffer 
How come my faith in you comes wit no cover 
Give me a sign and I might just fix my structure 
But no it seems you want me to suffer 

I have no others 
Lost my lover 
Now’s she takes another 
There’s no shield no cover 
 

DEAR GOD

Tell me what I do 
To lift this weight off my chest 
You gave life, can you give another 
What I’d do to hear you father 

DEAR GOD 

Tell me what to do 
Cuz I know not what I do 
And all this over thinking got me thinking 
If you can’t speak up 

DEAR GOD

Tell me what to do 
There are ways to see you 
Speak up father
Or I will see it through
