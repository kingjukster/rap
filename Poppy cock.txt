The problem with America is the people
The politicians cheat and lie 
The average guy think he can do better 
But he won’t get up and try 
And it’s all poppycock, yea it’s poppycock 
Because the average guy, is you and I 
we dream of a future
That’s looks much brighter 
But we won’t get up 
Our dreams die 
The world keeps turning 
And we aren’t learning 
We’re just the average guy 
We think it doesn’t matter 
We’re afraid to climb the ladder 
So we just get fatter 
As hope starts to cry 
And we blame the guy above us 
The ones that don’t love us 
They pick on the little guy 
Little do we know 
We reap what we sow 
But that’s between you and I
