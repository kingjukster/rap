I don’t do this for nobody 
Yea

Last girl left me for a jock 
Next day that man had another bitch 
Now she want me back, but I won’t fuck a bitch 
I got racks 
Buyin diamonds, icy stacks 
Make myself cold like a iceberg 
And you’re the titanic 
I’m finna wreck your life 
You’re gonna crash just like the Hispanics 
No grudges but you ain’t out of the clear 
Pull up to your house, let myself in
Grab a knife, couple stabs let it slide in
Throw you against the wall
Press rewind and do it all again
