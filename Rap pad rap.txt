It’s weird  
The way you stare me down  
Got me shivering like imma breakdown 
I don’t really know how to get around  
Don’t really feel like getting up  
Like I’m a big shot  
No that’s big cap  
I barely survive social interactions  
Can’t stand talking to people  
Nobody understands my current mental status  Mix that with an egotistical conscious 
Imma need an apparatus  
To fix this distance between my mind and god  But that’s long gone 
My god somethings really wrong  
I seen the Holy Ghost  
But he ghosted me  
To what degree do I need to be burned Before they let me free  
I spy like I see  
Two stones one bird  
All backwards like SpongeBob  
Did I lose my identity  
Or just the amenities that come with being me  Cuz it’s not very clear  
Why I drink all this beer but one of these times  Imma learn how to rhyme
