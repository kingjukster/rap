I remember that day I hit rock bottom 
I lost it all sitting by myself 
Thinking what the hell just happened 
One minute I’m kickin it with my friends 
The next I’m laying in my bed alone 
Where did my friends go 
Where did my life go 
Fell into a hole 
Still haven’t found my way out 
Still haven’t found myself 

I remember when I had something 
I remember when I could feel something 
Now I’m just empty 
Searching for a filling 
Haven’t found it 
Pray to god to show me the light 
(I swear I’m willing to fight 
Hands up ready on sight 
Just point me and push me ) 
I wish somebody would just tell me what to do 
I have what it takes 
But what good is a gun if it’s not loaded
If my minds blank all I’m ever gonna do is shoot blanks 
The men in my head 
They’re not moving they’re dead
They gotta a lot to say 
But never anything to be said
Because what’s a path to a lost soul
A way out? 
Maybe I’m lost for a reason 
But withh god is there ever a reason 
If you know where I’m going 
Can you just take me there 
 it’s really not fair 
Cuz life’s a bitch and I’m afraid to meet her sister 

So I’ve been told  to make my own path 
I walk forward but where am I going 
They tell me not to look back 
Why not if I can’t look back how do I learn from my mistakes 
I don’t a circle is what I walk 
Rinse and repeat until I can’t take it 
At nine grab the nine 
Pray to god one more time 
“if you got some master plan 
You better fucking spill 
Cuz if you don’t my brains will 
Onto this fucking carpet 
And we can have a conversation 
I’m done and you’re the last line 
And I mean it this time 
I don’t give a fuck 
I can’t do shit 
People call me lazy 
Maybe I’m just fucking crazy “
