She was my fix of henny, She had me trippin plenty 
I still feel the love she sent me 
I’d give her both my kidneys, I’d hope she love me 
I wish it was meant to be 
Now I hope for nothin, I ain’t been trustin 
I hate the hunches, I hardly function 
It’s a hard correction, I’ve lost consumption
Im so far gone, it’s all in my head 

I miss late nights after 2, I was there to learn 
You could teach me a thing or 2, about what the heart yearns 
I miss spending days with you
Just doing what the day brings
And when there wasn’t a thing to do
We cracked a beatbox to stranger things 

And I beat that box like I was meant for bigger things 
That pulling on my soul causing major pains 
That’s wind blowing as I’m sinking into the hurricane
It feels like years since the last time you came 
And im not getting off till I’m your mane 
I domesticated the cat, that pussy tame 
We wrote a story, way more than spitting game
I ate the alphabet, even spelt my name
