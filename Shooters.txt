Body: 
I pack that thing, on me 
I got the bands, on me 
I got your bitch, on me 
I got shooters, on me 
They drop a nigga that’s, on me 

I pack that thing, on me 
I got the bands, on me 
I got your bitch, on me 
I got shooters, on me 
They drop a nigga that’s, on me 

If you win the lotto 
My niggas on you 
Put two in the dome 
Nigga that’s on me
I ain’t ever sell drugs 
Cuz I was born with it 
Can you say the same 
I think not 
Cuz you lame with it
You needa level up your game 
Before you start fucking with me 
Cuz I’m harder than your girls nipples 
I got more ice on me than the titanic 
You keep fucking around and I’ll put you in a divine hammock 
Lock and loaded run into your house with that mother fucking thing on me 
Knock your bedroom door down 
The last thing you’ll hear before my niggas gun you downs is “nigga that’s on me”

I pack that thing, on me 
I got the bands, on me 
I got your bitch, on me 
I got shooters, on me 
They drop a nigga that’s, on me 

I pack that thing, on me 
I got the bands, on me 
I got your bitch, on me 
I got shooters, on me 
They drop a nigga that’s, on me
