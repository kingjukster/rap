Smoking on that gas, I’m too high 
Yea I flirted with your bitch, now it’s goodbye 
Niggas claim they too real, but don’t realize 
That they couldn’t see the vision, even with four eyes 
I’m a visionary, I got a vision just barely
Where I live just past my thirties 
My momma cries, it was too early 
On the inside it didn’t hurt me 

But later on I’d put together 
Something special,
Green light on the dock 
Home is a comfort spot
Loves a passing thought 
Quid pro quo, 
Give what you have got 
Take for free, you better not
Payback is the final stop
And it’s all educational 

I learned to switch code, to pick my battles 
I lost scope, but hopped right back on that saddle
They asked me what’s the matter
I told them what’s it matter 
We all really just matter 
It really couldn’t get much sadder
But what’s it matter 
We hop back on that saddle 
And make it matter 
Yes it matters, yes you matter 

A lost soul told me, a noose rope 
Pulled him from the pits of hell 
And I told him, a new soul 
Pulled the heaviest weight from the strongest shoulder 
And we argued for hours, was it a heavenly order
And what we agreed upon was a higher order
Not to say it’s him but it’s bigger than us 
It’s a big world bigger than us 
But what if we go to space and find out it’s just us 
Do you think what we have done is enough
