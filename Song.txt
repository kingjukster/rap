Yea yea I’m the man to beat
Pour it up, shot of Hennessy
Let’s talk about the insanity
Like why your girl stannin’ me
And why your fam a fan of me
That’s just how it really be
Cut from cloth, no pedigree
Make mistakes but never mistake me
Built different, DNA ain’t got no recipe
Legacy silent but destined to be
Move like a phantom, ain’t no checkin’ me


Whole squad coded in complexity
Turn pain to rhythm, that’s therapy
Still don’t fold, that’s rarity
She said my vibe got clarity
Now she cling tight like parody
Can’t clone style, that’s heresy

Crowned by fire, that’s royalty
I don’t talk much, let the aura speak
When I walk in, silence hit its peak
I don’t need hype, I’m the mystique

I rose from the dark with my soul on heat
Took Ls like lessons, made the pain repeat
Now every scar is a part of the beat
Write truth in the bars, let the real compete

Move in the shadows but my name hold light
Speak soft, but my silence still bite
Came clean, no gimmicks, no hype
I breathe rare air like I’m born mid-flight
Mind on chess but my heart on peace
Whole squad built from a different piece
If the throne ain’t real, I don’t take that seat
