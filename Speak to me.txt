I get emotional when I speak, I’m just tryna tell you what I see as the truth
I see your pain in those eyes, but i know you can make it through
I’m just tryna tell you I’m here for you, I’m in your corner
I’m not an evil man on the inside, I’m not like your former
This our forever story, our once upon a time 
I might overthink a lot, but I won’t let those thoughts of mine
Put distance between us, we meant to be together 
I’ll stand by you, through rain, sunshine storms and every other weather 
I trust you like sky divers trust their parachute 
You’re my life or death, I’m falling for you 
I fell, raised a new life, turned to a Phoenix for you
Pack my stuff, move to Arizona , there’s no limit to what I would do 
You need time to get it right, I got an unlimited supply, I can wait 
I never want to fight, lean on me when you cry, I’ll never take a break 
You’re running from your past, slow down, we can fight back 
I’ll pull you from that shadow, trust me, we can take your life back 

Coasting down this road on a solo night 
Driving through this tunnel with no light 
Light the match and let the lighter fly 
We can make this work just you and I
