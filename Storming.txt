I feel like I’m flying into a storm
It’s very deceitful, the weather is warm 
It gives the sweetest tenderness but still leaves cuts on my arm 
It spins circles around me not realizing it’s harm

I feel like the lightest leaf In the heaviest pile 
Even the brightest room hasn’t seen the sun in a while
So many feet, none take the shoe the extra mile 
I haven’t felt these feelings since I was a child 

I feel myself when I talk to you 
But is that enough to build a new
