Sometimes I wanna fly and see the sky 
But i come falling down to reality  
And go to my 9-5 in the morning 
The cycle continues 
But I can’t take it 
Keep it 6 feet 
Like Covid-19 anything closer and I’m getting sick 
 Baby proof my room cuz I’m Rick 
And anything sharp is my alcohol 
Need to feel that fire need the haul 
Of emotion 
Caution 
I’m explosive 
What lies ahead is behind 
The standards of living 
I can’t feel it so is it really there 
Maybe maybe not prolly gonna pull my hair 
She like that but I can’t feel that 
She tell me to relax 
But I can’t feel that I need wax 
And even then I’m itchin
Lookin over my shoulder twitchin 
Need my fix 
I don’t think they understand 
I didn’t ask for this it happened to me 
I’m addicted to addiction 
Flames brighter lm higher 
Or lower 
Glass empty 
Or fuller 
To be 
Or not to be 
Philosophy got me thinking 
If this knife got me feeling 
Maybe it’s actually healing
