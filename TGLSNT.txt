You remember long walks on the beach 
No socks just the sand between your feet 
No sounds just vibrations 
This feels nice but it’s not a vacation 
Remember when all I did was play PlayStation
Now it’s just on to the next paystation 
Im tryna hit big, save the whole damn nation 
That’s you 
That’s me 
That’s who, disagrees 
Rather take a L then pay a fee 
If loves not after me, I can double back for free 
It’s not insanity, If I plan it to be 
A work of art brought on so casually 
Nurture so carefully in to a masterpiece 
Would it be worth it for me 
Would I feel satisfactory 
Or would I feel bad for me 
Pity the rich?
Or pistol whip their dicks 
Ask them which 
They had it come in, pricks
Dancin with the devil on the summit bitch
You can’t help but run from it bitch 
You’re mind stuck on a moment bitch 
You lost but tryna own it bitch
