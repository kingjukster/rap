I feel like I might need a blessing
Someone come teach me a lesson 
A few bitches left me 
And that just raises the question 

When is it enough
What does it take to look in 
Head spinning thoughts tickin
How can I do this stuff 

Imma need you to answer that question 
What is this I’m reaching for 
What am I terrified for 
Until I know there isn’t much restin 

Head numb, what am I moving towards 
A lot of thoughts, running out of room in this notepad 
All those opportunities I could’ve had 
Open the door and close it, what am I moving towards 

It’s really starting to heat up 
A lot of pressure on the pot, and they want answers
A gun to my head, taking my thoughts for ransom 
I know not what I do, but is that really an answer 

My momma told me be tough
I know that’s a false adventure 
I can put on a smile 
But we all know life is rough 
You can tell me all you want 
I’ll shut up and do what you want 
It’ll take time but I’ll still self destruct 
I can be me but that’s something I don’t know how to be 
You expect the best but that’s something wild to me 

I’m learning, that’s the fight in me 
The constant banter in my head
The debate between life and death for me
It’s a long war that can’t be delayed any more 
There’s a lot to the puzzle
You can piece it together 
It’s hard to be me, you don’t know how to be 

I’ve looked into it, I’m out of breath 
Pain in my eyes, out of sight, not a threat
The most problematic man I’ve ever met 
There’s gotta be more to it, but I digress 

Death is the topic where we get no rest 
What happens, where do we go 
Would they miss me, we don’t really know 
Someone’s gotta know, let’s put it to the test 

You can put me in this place
You just can’t expect acceptance 
I’m just looking for a direction 
Who am I too speak up in the first place
