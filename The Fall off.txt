The fall off of Aubrey graham 
Inevitably like a crypto scam 
The man who couldn’t stand 
A week without something lower than venti, damnnnnn 

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Float to the windowsill, how more zesty can I bee 
He always two steps aheads, that’s money and fame 
Give me two shots he’s dead, that’s his friends in his lane
