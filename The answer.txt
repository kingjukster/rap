Collectively you are shit 
Respectively I have to inform you 
The bus leaves at 7 
And I’m lyrically inclined to send you to heaven 
Everybody wanna be the big brother 
Till father say he can only feed one of you
Cuz what’s harder heaven or hell
Eyes always on me like cameras(in a cell) and a celebrity 
Judging everything I do feeling like the paparazzi 
Always asking questions like a reporter 
No answer just success because I’m the answer feeling like Iverson 
Don’t show people my lows 
Just the highs cuz I’m a grinder 
Never tell them what’s next 
Cuz I never rest
