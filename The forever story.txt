I met her at the club 
A twinkle caught my eye 
Dancing with a vibe 
that you really couldn’t buy 

I asked her if she’d like to dance with us 
She told me to sit down pal you’re really not that guy 
I tried real hard to be persistent 
But she made it clear there was no story of you and I 

Now I’m not one to give up 
But there’s always a time to fold 
I stood back up and bought her a drink 
Told the bar keep to make sure it was cold
