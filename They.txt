Tory T on demon time 
I’m not gonna tell you
You can read my mind 
I can spell it out 
But you still gotta read it line by line 

T.O.P that’s where I’m finna be 
I.C.U but you don’t see me 
P.O.V through my eyes you see 
But you can’t be me, M.A.D
Mutually assured but you can’t destroy me 
I am inevitable, ain’t nothin but a snap to me
