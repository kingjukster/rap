Control your mind, control your check 
More to spend, more to debt 
I Know the cycle continues
Cause I’m the one that’s next 
Pray my people win too 
We all know what’s best 

I can’t lie 
there’s a couple times 
I wanted to go goodbye 
Now I’m coming back 
stronger than ever
Cuz I’m not too high 
I feel the ground 
like I’m Toph
I got many eyes
So they see me
And my many lies 
Every time 
They ask if 
I was fine 
I don’t really know this time
IM really on my grind 
Mustard on my greens 
Should of known I was on something 
Imma book made of sponge, absorbing 
Know my thoughts are the fun, 
I plan for the planned and the plans not planned 
So know when I say I understand, I UNDERSTAND

I got money, 
I got power, 
I got respect 
Catch me when I’m trippin,  yea
I’m all about my business, yea
My chain talk wild, 
still no snitchin, yea
I be pulling files, 
they still don’t get it, no
They can’t see the smoke, 
sneak diss thru the scope
We deal with false hope 
But we still democratic, tho
put your head to a vote 
Eneny, meeny, miny, moe
Send your ass to Idaho 
Idaho? No clue why tho 
Just felt like it, so I let it go
