Body: 
Let me tell you a story 
About this kid named Tory 
He stares into this mirror 
He don’t see himself, just fear
You have no idea how dead he felt 
When he prayed for his hand to be felt 
Darkness in his head, he wanted to be dead 
He looked around, nothing to be found 
There was an increasing problem 
He needed somebody to solve it 
He never made it a secret 
He hated his life, nobody believed it
Took to the paper and pen to relieve it 
Reliving his worst days, writing with no aim 
Hoping something will stick, something to pull him from this pit 
For him this isn’t a game 
It’s life or death, each line gives him a breathe 
He can’t deal with this hurt on his own time 
Fighting against death with a rhyme 
He hasn’t seen the sun in days 
Running out things to do so he just prays 
God is here today, he got big plans for you 
He not the only one, the devil speaks too
An angel to this planet, it takes a devil to plan it 
Tory T on demon time for an entire week
Guns, clips and a note, can you tell he’s weak
Two days later and he’s hanging from the ceiling 
4 page letter explaining his feelings 
18 years of trauma and they gonna pay 
I gotta long list and they’ll all get their day 

And that shit read: 


Part of me wants to kill everybody I see 
Part of me hates everything I be 
You and I are not the same, that took some time to see 
I hate everything you are 
Everything you stand for 
I don’t know what to tell you 
There is nothing you can sell me 
I’m coming to collect your debt 
You were born in this world 
I was constructed 
The devil had a plan, he instructed me
Kill everything you see
Hate everything they be 
Feel the pain and you will see 
They ain’t like you 
They don’t fight like you 
They ain’t hurt like you 
They don’t look like you
