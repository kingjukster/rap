It’s a trap, get low, listen for the footsteps 
Can’t you hear, it’s a gang, a whole lotta hood rep
We gonna have to take this slow, go my nigga go 
STOP, two steps, keep it slow 
Alright two up front, the one on the left has a pole 
On my word, run for the gat I’ll distract 
I stepped up he stepped over one shot off 
He got the gun but I got the bullet 
He steeped over like buddy you better cool it 
Nah buddy this is it, you take the mic and make it your life
