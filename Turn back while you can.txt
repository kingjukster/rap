Body: 
I was 12 years old when I figured it out 
It wasn’t a simple thing, it was covered in doubt 
I had to dig through the pain, center my diaphragm 
Just to struggle for years before I found this out 
I was fighting tears, it had me fearing my peers 
This shit not right, goin left in a car that I DO NOT STEAR
This not the shit you take lightly, liable to smite me 
This got me feeling on that drank, or is that the hype me 
The fake me? 
The hate me? 
The break me? 
But that’s really what I’m sayin, I’m tryin pick your brain 
Look in my eyes do I look sane? Nah I’m just playin 
I ain’t got eyes I got bags, wrestling with my demons 
I ain’t got eyes I got windows, it’s storming perfect timin 
I ain’t got eyes I got 

I remember when life was so nice 
When the coldest days where with snow and ice 
Back when high was off the ground, And love was to be found 

I’m a nihilist at heart, Just not from the start
I had to kick the petal, I was tempted to settle
I was in hot water, like tea in the kettle
