Why don’t you love me 
I treated you like monarchy 
It’s not hard to see 
You resented me 
Because you couldn’t understand me 
Sometimes you let the fire burn itself out 
Poking it only makes it bigger 
Be patient with the caterpillar and you’ll have a butterfly 
But you couldn’t wait 
You cut the cocoon open and now it’s a mess
I don’t blame you but you blame me 
And that makes it hard to live 
You stopped digging and let the diamonds sit in the dirt 
And I resent you for it 
I can’t talk to no nigga that don’t believe in me 
You got too high and looked over a blessing 
And it hurts me to my soul to get over you 
Sometimes I just stare and I can feel my heart blacken 
Cuz if my biggest supporter can’t believe in me who can 
And I deal with that on my own 
Accepting not being accepted 



What hurts the most is I trusted you 
You were the only opinion I cared about 
I asked you for guidance 
Anything I thought I ran by you
 And when I tried to tell you something 
You threw it back in my face 
That shit hurt me to my core 
Shit when it rains it pours 
And you had me crying till like 4 
In the morning wondering why 
When I finally told you what was on my mind 
You treated me like an outcast 
Like what I thought was an attack on our relationship 
I was just tryna tell you my feelings and you made it an ultimatum 
Having feelings or have you? 
And I chose you 
But that wasn’t enough 
I passed the days feeling nothing 
And that wasn’t good enough 
That one day I broke down and showed some emotion 
You ended it on the spot 
Shit guess you wasn’t kidding 
I was devastated 


But that wasn’t enough for you 
After everything you did 
You still wanted to be friends? 
And I obliged 
wanting to hold onto some figment of reality 
And you took advantage 
Every chance you got you took a shot 
You called me names 
you pinned the blame and tied it in a bow 
And what was I to do 
Nothing I took it with stride 
Holding onto to my imagination 
That somehow I could salvage this 
I disregarded my self respect to show you respect 
And what I got was drama and disrespect 
 I couldn’t see past what I thought was the girl for me 
I couldn’t see that you were really just hurting me
