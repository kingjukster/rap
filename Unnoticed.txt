Tell me how I spit these mad rhymes 
And I still don’t get noticed 
Tell me how I give you my heart 
And it still ain’t enough 
Tell me how I been the best 
And you still call me worst 

Yea tell me this 
I’ve been good, yeah 
Hold the door open for you, baby 
Cuz you my girl forever 
Just know these feelings for you, baby
They gonna last forever 
Come on baby this shit really hurts 
I’ve been loyal and yet you still tryna test me 
I’ve been here on god like bless me
