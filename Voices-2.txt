These voices in my head screaming 
I wish they would stop just for one second
So I could ask why they’re yelling
But they won’t stop can’t stop 
They are on a mission 
But what is that mission? To drive me crazy?
If so it’s working  
I’m up against the wall and I don’t know what to do 
I can’t think because they are to loud screaming Fuck you 
The harder I try to stop them the louder they get 
I’m on the verge of giving up 
But what will happen when I do that 
Will they finally stop screaming when they know they have won 
Probably not 
They won’t stop until there’s nothing left to scream at
