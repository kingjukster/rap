Body: 
I feel disrespected 
Spit in my face somebody get this bitch arrested 
I feel neglected 
What about me? 
Did you forget that we connected 

Who are you to say
It’s just another day 
You can sit in the back and enjoy the ride 
But at some point you gotta acknowledge the pride 
You are not who you think you are 
No high horse in here just a couple scars 
Ain’t nothing personal 
It’s just who you are 
A victim of circumstance 
Doesn’t make you the center of the universe 
A coward unless it’s over a verse 
Speak your mind  
You hide behind your insecurities 
Thinking they’ll help you socially 
Take a dive into your head 
Fix the mental 
Make your body a temple 
You’re looking for completion, self satisfaction 
Leave this earth with nothing 
Rather end it here
It’s all for something
