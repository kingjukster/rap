We some wannabe rappers tryna start up a wu tang
In reality I’m a broke ass nigga tryna fund a boo thing
Tryna put my homies on my back 
get us some cash like more than 50 racks
I’m tryna take us way back, like back in high school 
When skipping class to play bball was cool 
The difference between a normal day and iss 
A fucked up principle and a couple extra melatonin 
Got me pissed off walking around the school roamin 
Three years of Spanish and I don’t speak an ounce 
Well that’s not true I can count 
Uno, dos, tres
Cuatro, cinco, seis 
I been writin since the early days 
This music put me in a daze 
I just zone out and write away
