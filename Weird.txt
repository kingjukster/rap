It feels weird sitting here 
Everything I did in my life was to get here 
I fought tooth and nail 
Through racism fake friends and empty promises I wanted to bail 
I was so sure I loved life I just hated the place 
Now I’m not so sure did I love life or was the place just an excuse 
Seems like I’ve been miserable since the start 
Hiding behind purchases games clothes shoes all in my cart 
Life’s getting real 
I don’t want to be here asking god for an appeal 
You can send me to hell just be upfront 
You gave me talent and it cost my life I want a discount 
When I recount my life it don’t seem fair 
But in reality I didn’t care 
Thinking back on it 
Situationally it feels different when it’s you 
Reasonability fades when in reality it’s your turn 
Facts don’t sit well when they’re on you they burn 
When it’s you they lose all concern
It’s you against the world but it doesn’t have to be 
You don’t have to take it personally
