What do you want from me 
I can’t give you everything 
I’ve done given you the sky and the ocean 
Went to Jupiter and grabbed you a cup of ice 
Idk if I can make your drink any colder 
But you’ve gotten colder 
Shoulder freezing like we ain’t just break up a week ago 
Already spreading drama 
Like you forgot who I was 
But you got the audacity to say we still friends 
Friends? 
Got me fucked up speaking to me like shit ain’t happen
Speaking like you didn’t break my heart
Pulled it out and buried it in the dark 
I’ve tried to be reasonable 
you just keep telling me you an over thinker 
But I just keep thinking and thinking 
I told you my part 
I explained what I did and I apologized 
But I’m still fucking waiting for you to say something 
Cuz I have to believe you honestly don’t think you didn’t do anything 
But the days grow longer and you speak less
Each day passes and it seems like you really aren’t going to say anything 
And I just don’t think I can talk to someone who can’t admit their wrong
