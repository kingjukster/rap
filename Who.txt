Call me goku 
Yellow hair 
Leveled up like I’m super sayian 
Don’t test me 
My patience is thinner than a hair 
A fuse running low 
My anger will explode 
No escape mass destruction 
Like a spirt bomb 
A volcano eruption 
Lava flow is the only thing that will match my own
Do not underestimate me 
Doing so will leave you in a grave 
Like it’s destiny 
Yea
Like it’s destiny 
I know what you’re thinking 
He just said that 
I have to repeat myself 
Cuz y’all don’t get the picture unless the flash is on  
Like a camera flash I’m gone
