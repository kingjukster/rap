Lemme tell you about my life 
When I was 2 months old I got thrown down across a room 
And then they wonder why I’m so broken 
All these crazy emotions it’s so hard to control it 
Back and forth like I’m bipolar
Maybe I am 

No you’re not stop it 
Stop talking about this shit drop it 
You’re a bitch 
Level up 
Knock it 
You’re a king 
Here’s you’re crown 
Pick it up 
You dropped it
