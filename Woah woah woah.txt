Not to speak to soon 
But there’s a light at the end of that tunnel 
It’s flickering 
Keeps feeling like it’s getting farther away 
Nevertheless it’s there and that’s all as well 
It’s enough for me to get up in the morning 
I can throw that blade away 
Trade in the nine for some flowers I can give you 
Not today but maybe tmrw 
Got me feeling like a kid again 
Like I could live again
