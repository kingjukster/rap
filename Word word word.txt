I just realized I fake being fake 
Cuz to many fake being real 
The same ones take and steal 
I got fed up and hate just to hate 
They never read my appeal 
Threw it away, smack my face 
Stupid kid, never again 
These the many facts I feel 

These the many facts I feel
These…these…these the many facts I feel
Yea, yea, these the facts I feel 

These the many facts I feel
These…these…these the many facts I feel
Yea, yea, these the facts I feel 

Do you want to dance with a bomb threat?
I’m feeling freaky and a little Pocahontas
If you’re feeling itchy pull your trigger finger and we can go beyond this 
Imma Capricorn, cuz I cap in raps, then cap some more 
My casings lined with serial numbers, they call that your death date 
My goons be killers and hunters, they want your head to separate 

These the many facts I feel
These…these…these the many facts I feel
Yea, yea, these the facts I feel 

These the many facts I feel
These…these…these the many facts I feel
Yea, yea, these the facts I feel 

I chose to be a man
I turned my back on Uncle Sam 
There’s only so much I can do 
To make you understand 
That I am not the enemy 
But I can’t be your friend 
Take the mask off and the wolfs burnin
You’re nice but you’re the worse person 
Built your house with sand and a furnace 
Mommas titty in hand and you call it earnest 
Father nearing close I’m counting the minutes 
I got receipts, alls forgiven not forgotten 
Know I’m beat, but I gotta see the day 
my nigga B, blow your head down to your cheeks
