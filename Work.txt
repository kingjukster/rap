I’m boutta spaz for my boy Trevor 
Got me fucked up, think I’m not clever 
Might just lean back and pull this leaver 
Action rifle and send yo ass to heaven 
You can pray but you need a reverend 
This 223, all out of blessings 
No second chances, no confessions
I don’t do peace, I just teach lessons

Hop in the whip, this not no Tesla
Engine roar loud like it’s under pressure
Gloves stay black, no prints, no traces
Scope locked in, now I’m huntin’ faces
You ain’t my twin, I don’t play no mirror
Say you solid? I don’t see it clearer
Drop that name, now your fate in motion
Caught that charge, now the case in motion
