Body: 
I can feel the pressure, it’s tightening isn’t it?
Each time I breathe I’m a little bit hesitant 
Which one will be my last? It never ends 
I just want to have a blast, it always ends 

Sometimes you need to cry, to live your life without lies 

It’s happening again 
The skies turning dark, my thoughts are speaking again 
They scream and shout, angry at me for keeping doubt 
Punishment is coming, I need to reach out 

Directions are coming in 
Get the blade, prepared to sin 
Sit down, Imma need you to focus in 
Okay okay now we can begin 
Slide it across and break a grin 
Feels like a stabbing pin 
 
Reminds me of those times I could forget 
Now I’m stuck with a mind hiding some gruesome shit 

This world I live in is menacing 
Nothings fun unless it penetrating 
I don’t know what I’ve become but it’s hideous 
My perception changed, I just wanted to be a city kid
Bullets firing changed to slurs 
Generational curses on both sides it hurts
