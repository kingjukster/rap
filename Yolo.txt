Back on the streets 
I’m a lyrical genius 
Pull out the glock
Two shots he didn’t see it 
When I’m done with him 
He will be in a grave 
Should believe it when I said I was from the west side 
Dropped outta high school
But I been on this shit 
Won’t think twice to fuck a nigga up 
You say sum to the fam 
You say it to me 
Keep talking that shit 
You’ll be with the shits 
Have you floating in the river 
Don’t even bring your niggas
Cuz they’ll float too
