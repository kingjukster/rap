Body: 
All my niggas really with it 
We ain’t on no fake shit
We ain’t trippin
Fuck with me get your ass extended 
And no sir you will not be defended 
Your niggas are fake 
Shoulda checked your business 
Too bad cuz now I gotta end this 
Should’ve known you fucked with the wrong man 
When you saw the glock stand 
So tall it blew the ops man 
Now your homies at your funeral 
Claiming that you were wonderful 
OPTION 1
[but thinking damn your girl is beautiful 
That’s what happens when you ain’t picky with your niggas 
You get burned by them triggas 
I ain’t even have to kill ya 
I had you niggas pull a Melly 
Then I slid them a Millie 
That money really change people 
Too bad you weren’t with it 
Might’ve saved your life 
But now they got your wife]
OPTION 2
[Knowing you weren’t shit 
You a pussy ass nigga 
You’d rat if it saved you ass 
Now look at you covered in gas 
Now I gotta throw the match 
And I really am sorry 
That you couldn’t keep quiet 
But hey it is what it is 
And for you it is not 
Now I let this match drop ]
